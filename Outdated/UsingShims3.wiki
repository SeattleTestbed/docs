Suppose you're writing an echo server. This server encrypts all traffic on a per-connection basis, and it may be behind a Network Address Translator (NAT). As the application creator, you only need to focus on what is relevant to the core functionalities of the echo server. Your job is to implement it, such that it echoes back messages sent from its clients. Encryptions and NAT rerouting are handled by the underlying shim library.

Here is a sample echo server.

{{{
#!python

include ShimStackInterface.repy
include session.repy

server = ShimStackInterface('(RSAShim)')
}}}
