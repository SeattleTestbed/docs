This little tutorial shows how to use Repy V2 Shims as well as show you how to create your own Shims.

== What are shims ==
----

A shim is a way for a programmer to add or modify network functionality in a way that is completely transparent to the application programmer.   The key word is ''transparent'', since the application (intentionally) cannot tell if a shim is in use or not.   This allows application programmers to focus on their application's logic, while utilizing rich network functionality that may have been added by many different parties.   

Shims are combined together to form a ''shim stack'' which is an ordered set of shims that will act on a specific network communication (a listening socket, message, or connected socket).   Any number of shims can be used together in a shim stack.


The key features a shim must have:

1) it must provide the semantics of the repy network interface

2) it must be constructed to use the semantics of the repy network interface

3) it must have a small number of required methods necessary for the construction and management of shim stacks

== Using Shims in Application ==
----
As mentioned above, Shims can be used to modify the network behavior without changing any semantics. Lets take a look at an echo server application:

{{{
#!python
def echo_server(sockobj):
  def _echo_helper():
    while True:
      msg = sockobj.recv(1024)
      sockobj.send(msg)
  return _echo_helper


if callfunc == 'initialize':
  serverip = getmyip()
  serverport = 12345

  # Open a server connection.
  server_sock = listenforconnection(serverip, serverport)

  while True:
    try:
      (remoteip, remoteport, sockobj) = server_sock.getconnection()
    except SocketWouldBlockError:
      continue
    else:
      # Launch the echo server.
      createthread(echo_server(sockobj))
}}}

Now lets assume that the user wants to
