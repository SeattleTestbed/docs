class '''!ShimException''' (Exception): 
  The base shim exception. All other exceptions
  are derived from here.
  

class '''!ShimStackError''' (!ShimStackError):
  This error will usually be raised if we are unable
  to manipulate the shim stack. For example if we
  are trying to do a pop() or peek() on an empty stack.


class '''!ShimConfigError''' (!ShimException):
  This error means that the shim library could not
  properly configure the shims.


class '''!ShimArgumentError''' (!ShimException):
  This indicates that an argument was provided
  that does not match the expected argument for
  a function.
  

class '''!ShimNotFoundError''' (!ShimException):
  This error would be raised if a shim name
  is provided that is not found.


class '''!ShimInternalError''' (!ShimException):
  This error is raised if an error occurs while
  configuring the shims.
