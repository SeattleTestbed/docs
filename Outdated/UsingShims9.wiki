= Using Shims =

This tutorial illustrates how to use the shims library in your application, as well as how to create your own shims correctly.

== Using shims in your application ==
----

Suppose you're writing an echo server. This server encrypts all traffic on a per-connection basis, and it may be behind a Network Address Translator (NAT). As the application creator, you only need to focus on what is relevant to the core functionalities of the echo server. Encryptions and NAT rerouting are handled by the underlying shim library.

Here is a sample echo server. You need to tell the shim library what shims you would like to use. In this case, you want to encrypt the traffic. Since we're not sure if the network configuration changes, we insert a !NatDeciderShim. It automatically connects to a forwarder if the presence of a NAT is detected.

{{{
#!python
include ShimStackInterface.repy

server_shim = ShimStackInterface('(RSAShim)(NatDeciderShim)')

def server_callback(rip, rport, sock, th, lh):
  while True:
    msg = sock.recv(1024)
    sock.send(msg)

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  serverip = getmyip()
  server_shim.waitforconn(serverip, 12345, server_callback)
}}}

In writing the client, you don't need to specify what shims to use. The shim library automatically detects the shim stack on the server, and it subsequently inserts the correct shims into the client's stack to communicate with the server. This is known shim stack balancing.

Here is a simple echo client:

{{{
#!python
include ShimStackInterface.repy

client_shim = ShimStackInterface()

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  serverip = callargs[0]
  serverport = callargs[1]
  sock = client_shim.openconn(serverip, serverport)
  sock.send('Hello World')
}}}


In both cases involving the server and the client, you only need to initialize the !ShimStackInterface once for every type of shim stack you use. For instance, you decide to do a waitforconn on multiple ports and IPs. All these listeners use the same shim stack structure. You only need to initialize the shim stack once, say, at the top of the module or in the constructor. All subsequent operations can act on this shim stack instance.

In case you're wondering about the implementation details, the !ShimStackInterface actually creates a new shim stack for each operation. This, of course, has been abstracted away from you. It is one of our objectives to incur minimal changes if we decide to introduce shims to an existing application.

The public interface of the !ShimStackInterface is identical to the network system calls. The following public methods are defined. Their usage can be found in RepyLibrary.

 * !ShimStackInterface(shim_stack_string=""): Constructor.
 * waitforconn
 * openconn
 * stopcomm
 * recvmess
 * sendmess

When you obtain a reference to a handle or socket, you can manipulate it as if it is a normal system object. In specific, the following operations are defined on the socket-like object. Again, their usage can be found in RepyLibrary.

 * socket.send
 * socket.recv
 * socket.close

== Creating your own shims ==
----

Your own shim must be a subclass of !BaseShim, the super class of all shims. You don't need to include any special files.

{{{
#!python
class MyShim(BaseShim):
}}}

In your constructor, you should call the super class's constructor before the constructor returns. 

{{{
#!python
  def __init__(self, next_shim=None, optional_args=None):
    # I'm doing something here
    BaseShim.__init__(self, next_shim, optional_args)
    # I'm doing something else here
}}}

Always override the copy() and get_advertisement_string() method. The first defines how your shim can be duplicated. You need to specify how internal states, if any, are copied to the new instance of your shim. Here is an example.

{{{
#!python
  def copy(self):
    mycopy = MyShim()
    mycopy._internalstate = self._internalstate
    return mycopy
}}}
