  * More work on registerhttpcallback, fixing encoding problems.

'''Armon'''

  * Mostly worked on 'island' module (resource accouning in modules).
    * More explanation: islands emulate what repy looks like normally, but
      when running in an island the api calls are monitored. Ultimately
      will be able to determine what the resource restrictions affecting
      your program are.
