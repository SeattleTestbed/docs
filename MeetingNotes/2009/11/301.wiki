'''Justin'''

  * We have new developers this week, we'll introduce them and they'll
    talk about what they've been working on.

'''Evan'''

  * New developer.
  * First project: geolocation + googlemaps to map locations of vessels (gave demo)

'''Steve'''

  * New developer.
  * Learning python and repy.
  * Working on getting our existing tests to run through the unit test framework
    that Vjeko was developing.
  * Currently working on splitting up the softwareupdater tests.

'''Derek'''

  * New developer.
  * Adding support for the Nokia N800.
    * Most of the test failures were timing related (due to slowness of the N800).
    * Disk checking were main slowdown, so decreasing disk accesses sped things up.
  * Will be working on giving Google NativeClient file system access through repy
    (as well as rest of repy api).

'''Yoonsung'''

  * New developer.
  * Developing an http proxy in repy.
    * gave demo of using it as the proxy when running Firefox.

'''Monzur'''

  * Described admin duties to the new developers, including writing monitoring scripts.

'''Armon'''

  * (Note-take once again missed what Armon was saying, probably because of discussing
    things with him.)

'''Yafete'''

  * Described ViewPoints project. Demo not currently working.

'''Cosmin'''

  * Project: Containment in Seattle.
  * Addresses concerns regarding traffic entering/leaving the testbed. 

'''Eric''

  * Networking abstractions / Shims
  * NAT traversal

'''Jenn'''

  * Beginning work on resource allocation, to enable users to request specific
    resources they need and allow them to divide up and temporarily share their
    resources.

'''jsamuel'''

  * Changes to seattlegeni xmlrpc api to allow authenticating indirectly using user's
    private key. Request signing isn't implemented at this point and will likely need
    to be revisited in the future when time allows.
  * Found and fixed some bugs in the software updater that could cause an updater to
    not restart itself or the nodemanager after an update.
  * Things for new team members to possibly help with:
    * seattlegeni usability (help information, etc.)
    * tests and continuous build
    * seattlegeni utilities and reporting
