'''Justin'''

  * Tickets:
    * 8 opened (one opened twice)
    * 3 closed (one closed twice)
  * Worked on two different papers this week.
  * Beginning of the quarter coming up. People should keep an eye out for
    students who might be interested in joining our project, especially for
    developing using our platform.

'''Anthon'''

  * Working on gathering numbers for the paper (code coverage for python
    and repy with unit tests).

'''Conrad'''
 
  * Also working on gathering numbers for the paper.

'''Jason'''

  * Working on installer creator. The html side is done (will give demo at end of meeting).
  * Justin asks: please look through existing seattlegeni, especially display-related
    ones, and see which ones apply to the new seattlegeni and fix them.

'''Monzur'''

  * Working on the outstanding socket problem. Send hangs if socket is closed
    from another thread.
  * Working on a solution based on using select but may have bugs.
  * Reset 6 of the nodes that have nmmain running but not advertising, result
    is that 3 nodes are now advertising and 3 are still not.
  * Justin asks: please look through existing seattlegeni tickets and close ones that don't
    exist in the current seattlegeni or comment if they are still issues.


'''jsamuel'''

  * Made a light pass through the paper, mostly getting it to the point where
    it seems like it intends to be a paper, even if how I left it isn't very
    different in text content.
  * Namespace layer is closer. Just working through a last few repy tests that
    are failing (some are bugs in the tests, others are assuming functionality
    that we never explicitly support and which is now unsupported).
  * Narrowed down memory leak issues in seattlegeni node state transition
    scripts. It appears to be ultimately caused by the known socket issues
    which result in sockets and threads staying open and adding up.

'''Jenn'''

  * Finished testing autograder.
  * Haven't yet written tests for a p2p type application/assignment yet.
