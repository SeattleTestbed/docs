  * 15 tickets opened
  * not many closed
  * Spent time working on long running bugs with socket timeout this week.
  * This week the decision was made to have the new seattlegeni only support the new
    installer and the old seattlegeni only support the old installer.

'''Anthony'''

  * Working on the 10% resource usage for the installers.
  * Some issues with the disk I/O rate (Justin says maybe we should charge more for flush, not just by bytes).
  * General issues of what should be charging for different actions (seek, write, flush).
  * Installers are closing, need to work with Zach.
