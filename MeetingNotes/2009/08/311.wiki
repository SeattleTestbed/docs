'''Justin'''

  * Worked on grant proposals, papers, and the namespace isolation.
  * Worked on implementation of timeoutsocket. There are some issues with our socket semantics.
  * Soon we should have Seattle running on busses in Massachusets.
    * There will likely be issues we'll run into with the nodemanager not
      working well with frequently changing IP addresses, etc.

'''Kon'''

  * Over 600 planetlab nodes. Over 70 other nodes. 12-14 advertising NAT ips.
  * Working on porting code over to use parallelize.
  * Will add sleep() calls, etc. to decrease CPU usage.

'''Conrad'''

  * The new advertise.repy that parallelizes central lookup and dht lookup has
    been committed. 
  * Currently looking at the dht tests.
  * Worked on recursive namespace checking.

'''Jason'''

  * Continued writing tests for seattlegeni frontend. All tests done.
  * Fixed a few bugs in seattlegeni frontend.
  * Starting on customize installer creator. Will be a separate django
    application with an html and xmlrpc interface for customized installer
    creation. Seattlegeni will use this once it's done.

'''Anthony'''

  * Worked on final changes for 10% in installer.
  * Worked on namespace searching.

'''jsamuel'''

  * Got kinks worked out of seattlegeni running on blackbox (e.g. NAT
    communication problems that turned out to be in a deserialization
    library used by the NAT stuff, opendht communication hanging which
    appears to be solved/worked around by Conrad's parallelized
    advertise.repy that was just committed.)
  * Worked on namespache checking.

'''Monzur'''

  * Going through the scripts of Kon's to get familiar with the code
    and starting to work with some of the tickets related to it.
