Refresher: how to use the ticket system. Please take a look at ManagingTracTickets.
  1. Create a ticket.
    a. If it's your ticket for an enhancement, for example, explain high level what you're going to do.
    a. If it's a bug, give details about how to reproduce it / what you saw.
  1. Commit the fix.
    * In the commit message, say "This is a fix for problem X in #518". That is, be sure to use a hash mark right in front of the ticket number.
  1. Close the ticket, and say "Fixed in rXXX", be sure to write the letter "r" in front of the revision number from your commit.

0.1j appears to be ready to go, problems on windows don't appear to be related to the installer.

Two things added to style guide this week:
  1. Don't use os or other command execution methods, read the style guide to see what to do.
  1. Don't use change directory in code.

This week worked on backporting code from integration tests and deployment scripts. Did a handful of sysadmin stuff.

'''Eric'''

Rolled out service deployment and monitoring program (to run an arbitrary service on an arbitrary number of geni nodes). Problem ran into while doing this with having geni not releasing resources. While held up on that problem, for now have used a static service deployment that only runs it on ten nodes.

Also made changes to time.repy.

Also opened a bug about repy, repyhelper, etc. that we should talk about more.
