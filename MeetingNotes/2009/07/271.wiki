'''Justin'''

  * We attended the GEC5 conference last week (thus no meeting last week).
  * Tickets for previous week:
    * most closed: Conrad is the first person to close more tickets than Justin for the week (8 tickets)
    * total closed 20
    * total opened 24
  * Tickets for this week:
    * most closed: Conrad closed 10 tickets
    * total closed 24
    * total opened 12
  * August 8/9 (weekend) our group has been asked to give a presentation at a conference for
    CS educators in the northwest. We'd both give a demo/talk and a more detailed walk through
    of using it in a classroom.
  * Ideal next release: before our next meeting. 
 
'''Jenn'''

  * Went to the GEC5 conference.
  * Working on a better api for the autograder. It would be an easy way to go into emulab through
    us to make test suites and it will work with our autograder.

'''Eric'''

  * Still working on new time.repy to work with advertise.repy (so people can find timeservers and
    update time no matter where they are).
  * Will talk to Monzur about getting the deployment script up and running. It will try to keep
    vessels running some code, starting new vessels when necessary.
  * Seeking volunteers soon for people to try out the NAT traversal library. It should be ready
    on Wednesday. Will try to check it in tomorrow.

'''Yafet'''

  * Working with http and repy to be able to pass a given url to get html. Has it pretty
    much working. Deciding on how to format data when passed back to client code (e.g.
    how to handle the header).

'''Kon'''

 * Haven't finished the documentation.
 * Wrote a tool to run arbitrary code on the planetlab nodes and retrieve stdout/stderr.
 * Side discussion: we still need to come up with an exception heirarchy.
 * Counts:
   * We have around 480 nodes on planetlet.
   * About 120 have both the software updater and nodemanager running.
   * 40-ish other nodes, but we can't count those behind NATs currently.

'''Conrad'''

  * Primarily working on taking care of bugs in seattle, repy, and nodemanager.

'''Jason'''

  * For the past week, working on the frontend of the seattlegeni rewrite (html and xmlrpc)
  * xmlrpc almost done, hasn't started html view

'''Anthony'''

  * Working on sanity checks and updating 10% measurement scripts (to be able
    to integrate this in the customized installer so it will be more accurate).
  * Getting more familiar with the implementation of the nodemanager and repy.

'''Vjeko'''

  * Has migrated a handful of (mostly oddball) tests from old test framework to
    new test framework.
  * Wiki page is now called TestingFramework--Alpha

'''Monzur'''

  * Working on understanding/the rewrite of the node state transition scripts for
    the new seattlegeni.
  * Will start writing the code on Wednesday.
  * Created wiki page for writing integration tests (discusses integration test
    library).  

'''jsamuel'''

  * Working on seattlegeni. Monzur is working on the node state transition scripts.
    Jason is working on the frontends. jsamuel is working on the rest.
  * Aim is to have a basic, fully-working system by end of this week, and a tested
    version by end of next week. The launch the following week.

'''Zach'''

  * Cleaning up the installer. Aiming to have it done by next release.
