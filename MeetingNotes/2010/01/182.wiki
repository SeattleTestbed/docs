'''Justin'''

  * Some people still need to be on irc more.
  * Low ticket/commit volume lately. Either there are large chunks people
    are working on between commits or not much being done.
  * Looking into ways to make our work applicable to various research
    communities. Talked to some people at Microsoft (Redmond) about
    possibilities. Also worked out how it's applicable to the Python
    developer community (talked with Yoon about this).

'''Yoon'''

  * Gave demo of a P2P backup system application built on Seattle.
    * Just discussed it with Justin and started on it 24 hours ago,
      but rapid progress already.
    * The basic idea is there's a way to put files in and later
      retrieve files based on your public key.
    * You can also see which files you have stored locally that belong
      to peers and which peers are storing your files.
  * Working further on the proxy so that it can work with other library
    code changes (such as those Conrad is making).

'''Evan'''

  * Made changes to seash but waiting on code review from Conrad before
    checking in.
  * Working on demo application that builds in all-pairs-ping (ran into
    bug in experimentlib which was reported to jsamuel and he has now fixed). 

'''Steve'''

  * UTF test migration status:
    * Software updater test works in linux but has problems in windows. In
      Windows it blocks the utf test process from exiting but not in Linux.
    * Going through and making sure that tests he has ported are up to date
      with changes/new tests people have been making in svn.
    * Started to get the functionality for begin/end test scripts.

'''jsamuel'''

  * First pass at namespace layer for Repy API 2.0.
  * Fixed a bug and added a small feature to the experimentlib.
    * Bit by Python misuse. This is a wider issue in other parts of our
      codebase that there is now a separate ticket for (#828). 
  * Pushed new beta version to beta testbed.
  * Started setting up the new system to be used for testbed VMs, there
    is a problem with running Ubuntu 8.04 (LTS) so installed 9.10, instead.

'''Conrad'''

  * The http client and server libraries are done and working on testing now.
    * However, message body data should be provided to callback as a stream to lower memory overhead (#827)
  * Renamed registerhttpcallback.repy to httpserver.repy.

'''Monzur'''

  * Working on tracking down the problem with the advertise server.
    * The requests are timing out on the client side.
    * Not sure where the underlying problem is.
    * Suggested to Monzur: look at tcp session to see what is happening
      in those cases. Add sleep to callback. Check the setting on the
      underlying socket for the size limit of the connection queue.
      Basically try to see if it's just resource exhaustion.
