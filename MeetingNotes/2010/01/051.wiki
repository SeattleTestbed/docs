    how it gets started and making sure Python is installed.
  * There were some problems with the previous approach where
    it ran as root. Working on getting it to run as a user.

  * The resource accounting information will make it possible for us
    to make available to programs information about which resource
    is constraining the application.

'''Zack'''

  * Working more on Windows installers. Always more roadblocks.
    * The only problem at the moment is the difficulty of stopping
      seattle when it is running as a different user.
    * It oddly works using a DOS command by the admin but not by
      a process running as admin using our existing process kill
      functions.
