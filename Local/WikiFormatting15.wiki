= Documentation Style Guidelines =

 * Begin the page with a heading, enclosed with: {{{= =}}}
 * The immediate next paragraph of the document should contain a purpose summary for the document
 * Immediately following the purpose summary, insert the following snippet:
{{{
[[TOC(inline)]]
}}}
 * All section titles in the rest of the document must use nested heading tags: {{{== ==}}}, {{{=== ===}}}, and so on. 
 * Each section title must be '''preceded''' by a line break {{{[[BR]]}}} and immediately followed by a horizontal line {{{----}}}. Here's an example:
{{{
== Sending pings between a group of computers ==
}}}

 * Python/Repy code and Seash terminal interaction examples must be enclosed with: {{{{{{#!python }}}}}} or {{{{{{#!repy }}}}}}. Here's an example:
{{{
{{{
#!python
print "hello world"
}}}
}}}

 * For adding HTML code the {{{#!html}}} directive should be used
 
 * For CSS code, use the {{{#!C}}} directive
