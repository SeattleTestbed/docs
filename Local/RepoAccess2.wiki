To commit changes to the repository, you must have an ssh account on the svn server -- seattle.cs machine. To gain access email ivan@cs. Once you can ssh into the machine, you can use the following line to co the trunk:

  svn co svn+ssh://seattle.cs.washington.edu/svn/seattle/trunk/

To take a look inside the repository without checking anything out:
  svn list svn+ssh://testbed-ubuntu.cs.washington.edu/seattle/trunk/repy

To check out the entire seattle repository:
  svn checkout svn+ssh://testbed-ubuntu.cs.washington.edu/seattle

To check out a portion of it, e.g. just the repy code sub-folder:
  svn checkout svn+ssh://testbed-ubuntu.cs.washington.edu/seattle/trunk/repy

Once you make edits inside the repo, typical CVS usage applies. First do an update, then a commit:
  svn update
  svn commit

To add new or remove existing files/directories use:
  svn add [filename]
  svn remove [filename]

If you have conflicts, you must tell SV explicitly that you have resolved them, otherwise SVN will fail to commit\update these files:
svn resolve [filename]
