= Documentation Style Guidelines =

This document described how to edit wiki pages so that they have a uniform look and feel.   This is especially important for longer pages.

[[TOC(inline)]]

[[BR]]
== Article structure and contents ==
----

 * Begin the page with a heading, enclosed with: {{{= =}}}
 * The immediate next paragraph of the document should contain a purpose summary for the document
 * Immediately following the purpose summary, insert the following snippet:
{{{
[[TOC(inline)]]
}}}
 * All section titles in the rest of the document must use nested heading tags: {{{== ==}}}, {{{=== ===}}}, and so on. 
 * Each section title must be '''preceded''' by a line break {{{[[BR]]}}} and immediately followed by a horizontal line {{{----}}}. Here's an example:
{{{
[[BR]]
== Sending pings between a group of computers ==
----
}}}

 * Python/Repy code and Seash terminal interaction examples must be enclosed with: {{{{{{#!python }}}}}} or {{{{{{#!repy }}}}}}. Here's an example:
{{{
{{{
#!python
print "hello world"
}}}
}}}

 * For adding HTML code the {{{#!html}}} directive should be used
 
 * For CSS code, use the {{{#!C}}} directive

[[BR]]
== Linking to other articles within the wiki == #links
----

To prevent broken links due to renamed articles, all links to other articles within the wiki should be made explicitly by using the "{{{wiki:}}}" prefix. 

For example, do:

...use one of these...

{{{
[wiki:ProgrammersPage]
[wiki:ProgrammersPage Programmer Portal]
}}}

'''Do not do'''

{{{
BadName
[BadName]
[BadName This is a bad example]
}}}



Because the name of an article may change unexpectedly, the wiki: style is preferred.
