== centralizedputget Test ==
----

=== Purpose ===
Attempt to put a (k,v) into our centralized hash table and then get it back. On error send an email to some folks.

=== Deployment ===
To deploy centralizedputget, run the deploy_centralizedputget.py located in trunk/integrationtests/deployment_scripts/. Run the script with the option -c in order to set up the crontab on the machine as well to run centralizedputget once an hour. Create a folder in the same directory that the folder trunk/ is located. Create a second folder <target_folder> where you want to deploy the centralizedputget script. Run preparetest.py on this new folder. Then copy over the file deploy_centralizedputget.py from the deploy_scripts/ folder to the new folder that was just created. Then run the deploy_centralizedputget script using the following line:
{{{
python deploy_centralizedputget.py -c <target_folder> <target_log_folder>
}}}
<target_log_folder> is the folder where you want the logs from the centralizedputget script to be stored.

=== Schedule ===
This script runs once an hour. The current crontab line on blackbox looks like:
{{{
0 * * * * export GMAIL_USER='seattle.devel@gmail.com' && export GMAIL_PWD='repyrepy' && /usr/bin/python /home/integrationtester/deploy_test/centralizedputget.py > /home/integrationtester/deploy_test/cron_log.centralizedputget
