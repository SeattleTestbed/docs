= Deploying a New Version =
Explains how to go about deploying a new version of the code, which consists of two main steps: replacing the base installers that are incorporated in new installations, and updating the files that the software updaters on each node check for updates.

 1. First, log on to the main seattle server (seattle.cs.washington.edu).
  1. Make sure you are logged in as someone who will have full access to the update and base installer directories.
  1. Figure out which public and private keys you will use.
  1. Open trunk/nodemanager/nmmain.py and find where the version constant is set.
  1. Change the value to the appropriate version (e.g., "0.1d").
  1. Navigate to trunk/dist.
  1. Run "python update_and_build.py .. path/to/publickey path/to/privatekey version".
  1. Navigate to the base installer directory (/var/www/dist as of January 2009).
  1. scp the new files here (these will be the versioned files, e.g. seattle_linux0.1d.tgz, and the unversioned files, e.g. seattle_linux.tgz) over to /var/www/dist on the seattle geni server (seattlegeni.cs.washington.edu).
