= Documentation Style Guidelines =

== Article structure and contents ==

 * Begin the page with a heading, enclosed with: {{{= =}}}
 * The immediate next paragraph of the document should contain a purpose summary for the document
 * Immediately following the purpose summary, insert the following snippet:
{{{
[[TOC(inline)]]
}}}
 * All section titles in the rest of the document must use nested heading tags: {{{== ==}}}, {{{=== ===}}}, and so on. 
 * Each section title must be '''preceded''' by a line break {{{[[BR]]}}} and immediately followed by a horizontal line {{{----}}}. Here's an example:
{{{
== Sending pings between a group of computers ==
}}}

 * Python/Repy code and Seash terminal interaction examples must be enclosed with: {{{{{{#!python }}}}}} or {{{{{{#!repy }}}}}}. Here's an example:
{{{
{{{
#!python
print "hello world"
}}}
}}}

 * For adding HTML code the {{{#!html}}} directive should be used
 
 * For CSS code, use the {{{#!C}}} directive

== Linking to other articles within the wiki == #links
To prevent broken links due to renamed articles, all links to other articles within the wiki should be made explicitly by using the "{{{wiki:}}}" prefix. For example, instead of doing one of these...

{{{
ProgrammersPage
[ProgrammersPage]
[ProgrammersPage Programmer Portal]
}}}

...use one of these...

{{{
[wiki:ProgrammersPage]
[wiki:ProgrammersPage Programmer Portal]
}}}

Because the name of an article may change unexpectedly, the latter method is preferred.
