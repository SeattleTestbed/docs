== Introduction to Seattle Donation ==
----

By running Seattle on your home computer, workstation, or computer, you
are helping everyone using the Beraber framework! By making your
donation available to Seattle users, you are allowing users to try new   topologies of nodes. This enables both more accurate representations of
Internet (increased and varied latency times) and allows more
undergraduates, graduate students, and professors to test their
hypotheses on a internetwork-like testbed without charge.

On the download page, you may notice that it details that you are
donating resources on behalf of a specific user. By downloading the
installer from this page, you are donating resources to be owned by the
user detailed on this page. The owner of the donation then has the
flexibility to organize permissions and allocate vessels to specific
users and the general Seattle public.

The philosophy of the Seattle project is use donationed resources in a
way that is secure (including performance-isolation). Programs that run
donated resources are isolated so that a program can't write or read
files it isn't supposed to or do other bad things to your computer. The
Beraber framework also ensures fair play with each donation by
isolating the performance of your programs from the programs that run
on donated resources. Our promise to you is to use no more than 10% of
your computer's resources (things like RAM, CPU time, network bandwidth, and hard drive space).
One of the things we're working on is allowing you to reset the percentages or absolute
value to allow you to change the amount.

== Risk ==

Running any software on your system involves a small amount of risk.  A bug in any of the software you run can allow an attacker to do bad things with your computer.   Seattle is designed to make running Seattle code on your system risk free.   Seattle prevents programs from using too many resources, reading your files on the system, or doing other bad things to your computer.   

'''RISK TO YOUR SYSTEM''':   If we have a bug in the Seattle software that allows a malicious party to escape the protections of Seattle, they could have access with the privilege of the user account that runs Seattle.   We have tried to build Seattle using simple components that are well known and well tested to try to mitigate the risk.   To further minimize risk Seattle can be run in a restricted / non-privileged account, so if you're concerned about this, run Seattle as a restricted user.

If Seattle works correctly, the programs that run on our platform cannot harm your computer.   The program is limited to consume
only a small percent of the resources on the computer and cannot interfere with security or performance.

'''RISK TO OTHER INTERNET HOSTS''':   However, while the rate and source port of network traffic is restricted, the destination port and
destination IP are not.   This means there is some small risk they could be used for reflecting traffic, etc.   This is a very common feature for lots of different types of software you might install like Tor, most versions of !BitTorrent, etc. and so isn't limited to Seattle.   We've never seen someone do something malicious using our system, but we're working hard to build a version that prevents this entirely!

== Installing Seattle ==
----

Running Seattle on your machine is easy. Simply start the install script ({{{install.bat}}} on Windows or {{{install.sh}}} on other OSes)
and the application will do three things. 

 1. start Seattle on your computer

 2. start the software updater for Seattle

 3. insert Seattle and the software updater into your startup queue (crontab for linux/apple, startup items for windows) so that they run whenever you reboot or login.

== Pausing Seattle ==
----

To pause the execution of Seattle, run the python script
{{{seattlestopper.py}}} (or use the script {{{stop_seattle.sh}}}). To unpause, run
the python script {{{seattlestarter.py}}} (or use the script
{{{start_seattle.sh}}}). During the paused period, your computer's resources 
will not be consumed by student programs.

[[BR]]
== Uninstalling Seattle ==
----

If you decide to end your donation, Seattle can be uninstalled simply
by running the python script {{{uninstall.py}}} (or the script {{{uninstall.sh}}}).
This process will remove Seattle from the startup queue, deactivate the
main thread, and remove the execution from the user's crontab (if
applicable).   You can then safely delete the folder you installed Seattle in to completely remove it from your system.

== Comments or Questions ==

We would also like to know about your experiences with Seattle. If you
have any questions or comments please drop a message to our Seattle
user list! We're always striving to make a better experience for all.
