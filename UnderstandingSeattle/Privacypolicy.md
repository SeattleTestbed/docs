# Seattle Privacy Policy


This privacy policy sets out how Seattle uses your private information.   The Seattle program does not view your private information from other applications in any way.   Since the Seattle programs run in the background (without your interaction), you do not provide private information to Seattle.

Your computer or smartphone will transmit its current IP to a publicly accessible server periodically to allow access to students, researchers, and developers.  If you install an application that can act as a [wiki:UsingSensors Seattle Sensor], it will have a privacy policy you should also view.
