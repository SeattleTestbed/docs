= Introduction =
The Seattle Testbed consists of a large number of Seattle VMs (virtual machines) running on computing devices provided by volunteers. These donated VMs are made available to registered users through an infrastructure component called the [https://seattleclearinghouse.poly.edu/ Seattle Clearinghouse].

In addition to handing out resources donated to the general public, the Seattle Clearinghouse can also track donations on behalf of registered users. Every donation on their behalf will grant a user a greater number of resources on other machines in return.
