# Acceptable Use Policy

For the most part, the things that you shouldn't do aren't supported by the API. You're welcome to use our code for commercial projects, etc. Please see [our license (MIT)](../LICENSE) for details. 

Our use policy is roughly modeled on the [PlanetLab Acceptable Use Policy](http://www.planet-lab.org/aup).  The main things to know are: (1) no illegal activity, (2) don't try to hack into Seattle user machines (if you want to test a vulnerability, let us know, we have machines set aside for this), and (3) even if the system doesn't have outgoing or incoming IP / port restrictions, don't abuse this. Basically, it boils down to treating the system as though you're a network admin and it's on your network.
