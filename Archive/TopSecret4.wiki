 * TCP over UDP flow control
 * anonymous donation
 * other interactions with Tor project. 

= Overview =

To begin, this force will focus on multiplexing multiple reliable connections over UDP. This resembles TCP over UDP except (to start with) a single UDP connections is used for multiplexing multiple connections. Later on, this force will shift gears and move towards coordinating with the Tor project to handle anonymous donations by nodes that are running Tor.

If you do not have a sufficient background in networking, you should find a copy of Peter and Davie's 'Computer Networks' book and read the following chapter (listed for the 3rd edition of the book): 1, 2.4, 2.5, 5.1, 5.2, 6.
