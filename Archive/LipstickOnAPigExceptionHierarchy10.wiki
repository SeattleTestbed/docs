= Lipstick on a Pig Exception Hierarchy Proposal =

== Overview ==

The [wiki:Lipstickonapig Lipstick on a Pig] strike force is attempting to create a standard exception hierarchy for repy to provide a unified method to allow users to handle exceptions within repy programs.

== Purpose ==

  Currently the Repy library has inconsistent treatment and use of exceptions, which can be confusing and off-putting for new users. Our goal is to come up with a clear, uniform and logical way to present exceptions. The repy library functions have specific needs and goals, and the reflection hierarchy we're proposing reflects this.

 Our design makes use of existing python exceptions when it makes sense. This includes making use of exceptions such as !TypeError and !ValueError for argument passing to functions, and user generated errors such as !KeyError, !AttributeError, etc. We're introducing a new hierarchy which we feel represents the most relevant exceptional events that can occur during repy execution. Common operations in repy, such as dealing with the network and files, are given specific exceptions to allow users to account for errors they are likely to come across. 

 The hierarchy we designed is meant to account for the specific types of errors which can arise in Repy. The heirarchy in Repy is meant to be used in conjunction with some native Python exceptions, where it makes the most sense. For example, having network exceptions for repy library calls made sense, while creating wrappers for python exceptions such as !TypeError and !ValueError did not.

== Proposed Repy Hierarchy ==

Below is our proposed exception hierarchy. The !RepyException tree is separate from !RepyException to show how the two are meant to be distinct, although !RepyException is a subclass of Python's Exception.

 +-- IOError
   |

== Comparison to Python ==

 The python builtins tend to throw the same types of errors, and repy is meant to mimic this behavior. For example, builtins overwhelmingly raise {{{TypeError}}} when passed an argument of the wrong type, and raise {{{ValueError}}} when passed an incorrect value (such as a positive number instead of a negative one). 

 Repy exceptions are also meant to be less cryptic than some of the python exceptions. The socket.* errors for example were quite cryptic for new users, which resulted in the creation of {{{AddressError}}} rather than using python's {{{socket.gaierror}}}.

#!comment
 * Python library calls tend to throw type errors when arguments of the wrong types are passed in, so Repy mimics that
 * Value errors are when an invalid value, but correct type, such as a negative when expecting a positive are passed into a function.
 * Instead of cryptic Socket.* errors, Repy uses a clearer exception name. (Ex. Socket.gaierror vs AddressError)

TODO: Example user code to catch a network/file error, compared to how it would look with only python code.
=== Network Examples ===

==== Host Name Example ====
In native python, socket errors are defined in the socket module. Since repy has no concept of modules, and doesn't allow imports, it doesn't make sense to use the code snippet below.
{{{
#!python
import socket

try:
  socket.gethostbyname_ex("somerandomhostname")
except socket.error:
  #recover from error
  #note the use of socket.error rather than socket.gaierror or socket.herror. It's unclear which would be better in this context
}}}

Instead, the code would look like
{{{
#!python
try:
  gethostbyname_ex("somerandomhostname")
except AddressError:
  #recover from error
}}}


==== Connection Example ====
The way of interacting with sockets is also different from regular python:

{{{
#!python
import socket

try:
  s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  s.connect((some_user_input, 12347))
  #use s to send/receive info
except socket.gaierror, e:
  #do something to account for invalid host
except socket.timeout:
  #handle the host timing out
finally:
  s.close()
}}}

Repy version:
{{{
#!python
try:
  s = openconn(some_user_input, 12347)
  #use s to send/receive info
except AddressError, e
  #handle the invald host
except TimeoutError, e:
  #handle the host timing out
finally:
  stopcomm(s)
}}}

The exception handing for both cases are meant to be similar. We aimed to keep the programming model familiar enough to programmers with a python background, but also more user friendly to those just staring out with repy. Just as {{{openconn}}} and {{{sendmess}}} provide easy access for users to interact over networks, {{{NetworkError}}} and its subclasses are meant to facilitate convenient handling of common errors that can occur.
