The Apache settings can all be found in /etc/apache2/.

The primary configuration file (that specific the django path, and URL mappings, http/https mappings, etc) is /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

Note that the GENI site uses a SSL certificate and uses https:// (port 443) for all URLs that map into the GENI portal.

== Django setup ==
----

The GENI django code is currently hard-coded in Apache config file 000-default to live in /home/geni/geni_production/. The Django settings module must have the path geni_private.settings. Typically the directory layout used by Django is the following:

{{{
/home/geni/
 |
 |-- /home/geni/geni/          <-- GENI portal code deployed with /trunk/www/geni/deploy_geni.py
 |
 |-- /home/geni/geni_private/  <-- contains settings.py
 |
 |-- __init__.py               <-- blank file enabling import of geni.*
}}}
