# Overview


## RSA implementation


Coding Sprint: Feb 14th


Jan 10th - Jan 17th

Build working mod arithmetic for any numbers.

Jan 17th - Jan 24th

Learn how to "pack" / "unpack" binary data into numbers.   (if we can use openSSH / openSSL keys then it's worth the time to code it!!!)

Jan 24th - Jan 31st 

Have primality testing working

Jan 31st - Feb 7th 

Key generation working

Feb 7th - Feb 12th

Wrap up and programmer interface (key conversion)

### Mar 17th - Mar 24

Port of pycrypto RSA to repy is nearly complete. Appropriate interface and documentation is still needed.

Implement RSA key representation and storage.
Evaluate and begin port of OSRNG and Fortuna PRNG.
Consider PKCS 1 RSAES-OAEP encryption scheme.
