= SeattleGENI in Production =

The SeattleGENI portal runs on Apache and uses mod_python to interface with django.
This page describes how to redeploy SeattleGENI from the current svn trunk as well
as some additional configuration information for using SeattleGENI in production.

 * For info on installing the necessary software to run GENI, see GeniInstallation.
 * For info on running a test/development version of the GENI portal using the Django built-in HTTP test server, see [wiki:GENIPortalTesting]

== Apache Settings ==
----

The Apache settings on our server can all be found in /etc/apache2/. The general information is described in GeniInstallation.

The primary configuration file (that specific the django path, and URL mappings, http/https mappings, etc) is /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

Note that the GENI site uses a SSL certificate and uses https:// (port 443) for all URLs that map into the GENI portal.

== Logrotate ==
----

The SeattleGENI website's log data goes to the apache error log. However, the log files of the
individual scripts (polling daemons, transition scripts, lockserver, and backend) go to file
in the /home/geni/logs directory. These need to be rotated by logrotate.

We use the following logrotate configuration (found in `/etc/logrotate.d/seattlegeni`):

{{{
/home/geni/logs/*.log {
  rotate 60
  daily
  compress
  missingok
  notifempty
  # The seattlegeni scripts don't know how to start a new log file, so we have
  # logrotate make a copy of the log files and truncate the original ones.
  copytruncate
  # move the compressed files into the 'archived' directory that's in the same
  # directory as the log files themselves.
  olddir archived
}


}}}

== Redeploying SeattleGENI from SVN ==
----

To deploy SeattleGENI code from SVN trunk into production:
  1. Log in to either seattlegeni.cs or blackbox.cs (depending on which installation you are updating).
  1. Get a root shell: `sudo -i`
  1. Open the screen running as root: `screen -r`
  1. There should be only one session in the screen and you will find yourself looking at a running instance of `start_seattlegeni_components.sh` with output that looks like this:
{{{
root@blackbox:~# /home/geni/start_seattlegeni_components.sh
Starting lockserver.
Starting backend.
Gracefully restarting apache.
Starting check_active_db_nodes.py.
Starting transition script transition_donation_to_canonical
Starting transition script transition_canonical_to_onepercentmanyevents
Starting transition script transition_onepercentmanyevents_to_onepercentmanyevents
All components started. Kill this process (CTRL-C or 'kill 24038') to stop all started components (except apache).
}}}
  1. Press CTRL-C and wait for `start_seattlegeni_components.sh` to exit (you will see "Shutting down seattlegeni components." a few times, that's OK).
  1. Run the command `/home/geni/update_seattlegeni_from_trunk.sh`. Answer "y" when it asks. It will look like this:
{{{
root@blackbox:~# /home/geni/update_seattlegeni_from_trunk.sh
A    trunk/dist/rebuild_base_installers_for_seattlegeni.sh
U    trunk/dist/update_software.py
A    trunk/dist/push_update_to_all_clients.sh
Updated to revision 3052.

Deployed successfully. The file trunk/seattlegeni/README.txt contains the
rest of the info you'll need to get things running.
}}}
  1. Now run `/home/geni/start_seattlegeni_components.sh`. It will look like this (just like you saw when you connected to the screen session):
{{{
root@blackbox:~# /home/geni/start_seattlegeni_components.sh
Starting lockserver.
Starting backend.
Gracefully restarting apache.
Starting check_active_db_nodes.py.
Starting transition script transition_donation_to_canonical
Starting transition script transition_canonical_to_onepercentmanyevents
Starting transition script transition_onepercentmanyevents_to_onepercentmanyevents
All components started. Kill this process (CTRL-C or 'kill 20452') to stop all started components (except apache).
}}}
  1. Get out of screen (either CTRL-SHIFT-A then CTRL-SHIFT-D or just close your terminal if you don't trust your screen skills).
