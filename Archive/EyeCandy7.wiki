= Eye candy =

 * Seattle/GENI website
 * Web back end improvements.

= Overview = 

This force is concerned with the GENI web portal. This portal consists of html/css/javascript code that executes in the browser and web back end code that runs on the server and interacts with the database as well as Seattle nodes. There are numerous improvements that need to be implemented and various extensions that we are going to work on throughout the quarter.

There is a production server that runs the GENI portal, and test server that is used for development work. We will periodically push updates to the production server once the new code has been extensively tested and has been verified to work.
