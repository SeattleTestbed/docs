This page will hopefully get us more organized in our approach in adding automatic support for [http://www.emulab.net/ emulab].  Anyone is welcome to edit this page in a constructive manner in spirit of conversation!

== Completed work ==

 * None yet :(

== Plan of Attack ==

 * Provide XMLRPC interface using [https://www.emulab.net/downloads/xmlrpc/script_wrapper.py script_wrapper.py], fix up so it gives the functionality that a teacher would want
 * Assume that ns files are already supplied, these can be created via [https://www.emulab.net/buildui/bui.php3 a java GUI] or [http://users.emulab.net/trac/emulab/wiki/Tutorial by hand].  We'd like two to test with (one with web-server-like topology, another with two hosts end-to-end).
   * ns file must have a [http://users.emulab.net/trac/emulab/wiki/nscommands#tb-set-node-startcmd tb-set-node-startcmd] contained near the end to grab the installer and configure the Seattle installation with the tester's public key.  
     * An alternative is to make [http://users.emulab.net/trac/emulab/wiki/Tutorial#CustomOSImages our own os boot image], but this isn't upgradable.  However, the [http://users.emulab.net/trac/emulab/wiki/Tutorial tutorial] claims that this is faster than wgeting an installer..

''Questions yet to be answered are below'':
     * Where should the customized installer be stored?
     * How is the script placed on the nodes initially?  Is it run from client-side?
     * What specific steps are required to run Seattle on all emulab machines?  These steps should go in the *.sh file.


=== Quick outline (1/20/09) ===

 * Installer (seattle_linux.tgz) will be pre-loaded with assignment private/public keys specific to the nsfile and network group on emulab
 * User will be able to interact with resources with given assignment credentials against the DHT server
 * Web server will facilitate linking of multiple assignments to user
