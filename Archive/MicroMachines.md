# Micro-Machines
 * Portability to mobile devices
 * Location services
 * MobileASL project support

## Unit Tests on Windows Mobile

 * Unit tests use subprocess so I do a basic check if MobileCE and switched to using launchPythonScript from windows_api
 * run_tests.py imports repy_constants and uses that to run unit tests instead of looking in current directory.
