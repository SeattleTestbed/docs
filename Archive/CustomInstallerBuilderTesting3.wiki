= Testing the Customized Installer =

This page describes how you run a customized installer test server. It makes the assumption that you are attempting to do so on the seattle.cs machine.

== Running Customized Installer Test Server ==
----

'''In all that follows, $USERNAME refers to your account name on seattle.cs.'''

 * '''Step 1:''' Get ivan to create a Django settings file for you on seattle.cs. This file will live in /home/ivan/geni_dev_private/ and will be called settings_$USERNAME.py, 

 * '''Step 2:''' Modify your .bashrc file to add two new paths to the PYTHONPATH environment variable, and to create a new environment variable:

{{{
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/$USERNAME/geni_dev_private/:/home/ivan/web_installers_dev/:/home/$USERNAME/trunk/:/home/ivan/geni_dev_private/:/home/$USERNAME/geni_dev/:
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='web_installers_private.settings_$USERNAME'
}}}


You should log out and log back in for the changes to take effect in your shell.   (You can also start a new shell by typing {{{bash}}})

 * '''Step 3:''' Checkout Seattle project trunk, and make web_installers importable from python:

{{{
$ svn co svn+ssh://$USERNAME@seattle.cs.washington.edu/seattle/trunk/

  # This will check out the Seattle trunk from SVN
  # The commands below assume that this trunk is located in /home/$USERNAME/trunk/

$ mkdir /home/$USERNAME/web_installers_dev/
$ touch /home/$USERNAME/web_installers_dev/__init__.py
}}}


 * '''Step 4:''' Run the customized installer test server from the web_installers_dev directory using the 'django-admin.py runserver' command. This command takes a single argument IP:PORT. If you would like the server to be accessible externally, the IP should be 128.208.3.86 on seattle.cs. The PORT needs to be something that does not conflict with existing applications. A good number to try is something in the 8K range. Here is example code:

{{{
$ cd /home/$USERNAME/web_installers_dev/
$ django-admin.py runserver 128.208.3.86:8090
}}}

 * '''Step 5:''' If you see the following output, your server is running and is accessible at http://128.208.3.86:8090/

{{{
Validating models...
0 errors found

Django version 1.0.2 final, using settings 'web_installers_private.settings_$USERNAME'
Development server is running at http://128.208.3.86:8090/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
}}}

 * '''Step 6:''' Note that the settings file remaps customized installer's URL_PREFIX. This means that you should use http://128.208.3.86:8090/web_installers_dev/customized_installer/ for accessing your test server.
