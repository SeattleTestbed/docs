# Strike Force

**''strike force (n.) -- an armed force, usually small in size, that is equipped to deliver a strong offensive.**''

Rather than dividing tasks by individual, we will set a small team on each task and have them focus their efforts.   Project members will belong to one or more teams and will be responsible for helping those teams to meet their goals.   There will be weekly coding sprints (Saturdays) where Justin and Ivan will be available to try and push the teams to meet their deadlines.   There would likely be ~2 teams that would sprint toward different goals on the same day and Justin and Ivan will work alternatively with them as needed.

The requirements are:
 1. All the team members must meet for at least 2 hours on whatever day the team decides on among themselves (likely Saturday). Its all or nothing I think.

 2. We have to meet in the Seattle lab -- if we can't use it for this then its useless to us -- we have to actively improve any deficiencies it might have

 3. The entire time in the meetings is spent on Seattle work 

 4. Teams must keep the MilestonesFile in the svn repository up to date
