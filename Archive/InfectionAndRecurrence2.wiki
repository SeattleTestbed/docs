Coding Sprint: Jan 17th


Jan 10th - Jan 15th

Sal: Bring Justin's Python "deployment" program up to the standards specified in the code style guidelines and add unit tests.   Ensure that information is being logged from the program running on remote systems.

Brent: Check to see if the state of the files that are on the system is normal and if not log enough information that we can understand the issue.

Cosmin: Check the state of the running processes and if something is abnormal, log enough information that we understand the problem.

Carter: Build scripts that completely uninstall a failed install or otherwise clean up as needed.
