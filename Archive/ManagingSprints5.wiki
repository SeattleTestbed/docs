= Managing Sprints =

The [http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/svn/seattle/trunk/milestones.txt milestones.txt file] located in /seattle/trunk/milestones.txt maintains sprint information for Seattle strike forces.

== milestones.txt format ==

The milestones.txt file is composed of sprint snippets that are separated by newlines and have the following format:
{{{
:sprint
strikeforce
date
name1 task1
name2 task2
}}} 

Where:
 * strikeforce is the name of the strike force
 * date is in mm/dd/yyyy format
 * names are person names of those involved in the sprint
 * tasks are short descriptions of the task corresponding to each person

You can add comments to the file, and possibly comment out old sprints by using the '#' symbol. '''Note: right now the parser ignores all lines containing #, not just lines that start with #.'''

At the end of your development cycle for the sprint, your should pre-append an svn revision number that contains all your committed files to the line with your name. For example, change this line:
{{{
name1 task1
}}}
to this line (if your svn revision is rev1):
{{{
rev1 name1 task1
}}}
