= Overview = 

The [http://code.google.com/p/octopy/ octopy project] aims to produce a very rudimentary implementation of !MapReduce in python. Here is a [http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2009/01/02/octopy-quick-and-easy-mapreduce-for-python/ blog post] with some more details of the project. Lisping will concentrate on porting this code to Seattle as a user program. The port should be easy to do as octopy is written in python and is a single file of about 700 lines of code. The next steps for Lisping is to work on numerous improvements to this code to make it more fault tolerant and more useful. The ideal is to reproduce a minimal Hadoop-like service in Seattle.
