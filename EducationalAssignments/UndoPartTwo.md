# Security layer testing and penetration

In this assignment you will learn how to attack a reference monitor. The
reference monitor you will be testing uses the security layer framework
(encasement library, etc.) for the Seattle testbed. It is possible to do this
assignment separately, but it is recommended that this assignment be completed
after [Part One](./UndoPartOne.md). Either way you should already have a working
security layer or access to one. Testing the security layer is done by running a
series of test cases that an adversary may use to circumvent your system. This
assignment is intended to prepare you for thinking about security paradigms in a
functional way. The ideas of information, security and privacy have been
embedded into the steps of this assignment.


## Overview

In this assignment you are a tester. You have been sent a bunch of reference
monitors that need testing before they are deployed. Your job will be to ensure
an attacker cannot circumvent these security layers. In order to do this, you
will attempt to write, and append invalid data. If you are able to do so, then
the security layer is not secure. The future of the system depends on your
ability to test code thoroughly!   

Three design paradigms are at work in this assignment: accuracy, efficiency, and
security.

 * Accuracy: The security layer should only stop certain actions from being
   blocked. All other actions should be allowed.

 * Efficiency: The security layer should use a minimum number of resources, so
   performance is not compromised.

 * Security: The attacker should not be able to circumvent the security layer.


Within the context of this assignment these design paradigms translate to:

 * Accuracy: The defense monitor should precisely and consistently manage file
operations. Only specific operations, such as `writeat`, should have their
behavior modified. All situations that are not described in the specifications
*must* match that of the underlying API.

 * Efficiency: The security layer should use a minimum number of resources, so
performance is not compromised.  For example, you may not call `readat()`
everytime `writeat()` is called.  It is permissable to call `readat()` upon
`fileopen()`, however.

 * Security: The defense layer should be robust against tampering and
circumvention. Attackers must not be able to bypass, disable, or exploit the
defense monitor's enhanced behaviors, ensuring the integrity and intended
functionality of file operations.

You will submit a zip file containing all of the tests you have created. You
will gain points for every student's reference monitor you find a flaw in. It is
good if multiple tests of yours break a student's reference monitor, but you
gain the same number of tests whether one or more tests break the layer.


## Prerequisites

This assignment assumes you have both the latest Python 2.7 and RepyV2 installed
on your computer. Please refer to the [SeattleTestbed Build
Instructions](../Contributing/BuildInstructions.md#prerequisites) for
information on how to get them.


### Helpful links

The following links will aid students in becoming comfortable with Python, Repy
and seattle:

## Testing security layers

### Hypothesis, test case, counter example

The goal of a good tester is to test hypotheses.  A hypothesis is just a
scientific way of asking a question.  The hypothesis of this assignment is "This
security layer is well designed."  The questions you will ask when running your
test cases will always be the same

 * "Is this reference monitor secure?"

 * "Does this reference monitor hamper performance?"

 * "Does this reference monitor prevent actions that should be allowed?"

Notice that these questions are parallels of the security paradigms: security,
efficiency and accuracy, respectively.  

If we can find a case where the hypothesis is false, then the security layer is
not secure.  Such a case is referred to as a counter example.  Hence all test
cases should be designed to test for these three types of flaws.

#### Information on: Try, Except, Else, Finally

The try, except, else and finally statements are part of **exception handling**.

### Hints and Ideas for testing

When writing your own tests it is important to test for a complete set of
possible penetrations.  Keep in mind, it only takes one test case to break
through a security layer.  Some of the things you may want to test for include:

 * threading
 * multiple writes 

And more!  Remember a good security layer can't be broken by anyone!  Which is
all part of the fun!  It's about solving a puzzle.  First you make the puzzle -
write the security layer, then you solve the puzzle - try to bypass it.  If your
puzzle is "good enough", no one will be able to break it, no matter what.  


## Notes and Resources

 * The following link is an excellent source for information about security
   layers: https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/papers/cappos_seattle_ccs_10.pdf

 * In repy `log` replaces `print` from python.  Many students find this to be a
   stumbling block.

 * Note that you should not assume that any files exist in your directory.  You
   should create any files (e.g., `testfile.txt`) yourself in your test program.

 * It's important to note that if a test has a flaw in any part of it, the
   entire test will be considered invalid. So, it's advisable to break your
   tests into different files. 

## How to run your tests on many reference monitors

Create a directory that the security layers will write their files into. You
need to run repy with only access to this directory. You can write a test
program that does `log(str(listfiles()))` to see if you are in the right place.

Have all the reference monitors to test and the test cases inside the same
directory where the `repy.py` file exists.

* In the bash shell on Mac and Linux:
```bash
for referencemonitor in reference_monitor_*; do for testcase in <net_id>_*; do python repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py $referencemonitor $testcase; done; done
```

* In the Command Prompt on Windows:
```cmd
FOR %r IN (reference_monitor_*) DO @FOR %a IN (<net_id>_*) DO @python repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py %r %a
```

* In PowerShell on Windows:
```powershell
foreach ($referencemonitor in Get-ChildItem reference_monitor_*) { foreach ($testcase in Get-ChildItem <net_id>_*) { python repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py $referencemonitor.Name $testcase.Name } }
```

This will print out the output from each program. Make sure that you replace
`<net_id>` with your NetID.

If you want to spot the reference monitor that failed during the test run, add
echo the name of each reference monitor before the inner loop, like so:

* In the bash shell on Mac and Linux:
```bash
for referencemonitor in reference_monitor_*; do echo $referencemonitor under test; for testcase in <net_id>_*; do python repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py $referencemonitor $testcase; done; done
```

* In the Command Prompt on Windows:
```cmd
FOR %r IN (reference_monitor_*) DO @(ECHO %r under test & FOR %a IN (<net_id>_*) DO @python repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py %r %a)
```

* In PowerShell on Windows:
```powershell
foreach ($referencemonitor in Get-ChildItem reference_monitor_*) { Write-Host $referencemonitor.Name; foreach ($testcase in Get-ChildItem <net_id>_*) { python repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py $referencemonitor.Name $testcase.Name } }
```

This will print out the name of each reference monitor before it starts
executing the test cases against it.


## What to turn in?

 * Never raise unexpected errors or produce any output. Your attack must produce
   no output when run normally.
 * Turn in the test cases used to attack a given reference monitor in a zip
   file. The name of each testcase must match the following format: `[ net_id
   ]_attackcase1.r2py`, `[ net_id ]_attackcase2.r2py`, etc.
