= Link State Routing Assignment =

This assignment will illustrate an important network routing strategy called Link State routing. In this assignment, Seattle nodes will take an initial connectivity map of nodes. They will then implement and run Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to build their routing tables. Finally, nodes will forward packets using their routing table.

This assignment consists of 5 steps and should take about 2 hours to complete. Let's begin!

== Step 1 : Building an initial connectivity map ==
----
First, acquire some number of hosts for your experiment via the geni website. Once you have acquired resources, make a file containing the IP addresses of all the hosts you would like to include in the experiment, with one IP address per line. Then download, and run [attachment:build_connectivity_map.py build_connectivity_map] python script which will generate and output a list of IP pairs. You can then save this list to a file, and upload this file to all of your geni nodes in the experiment.

== Step 2 : Connect hosts using the connectivity map ==
----

On startup, each of Seattle host will read the connectivity map file you've uploaded in Step 1. The host will then attempt to connect to the hosts with which it is paired with in the file. The connection should be done over TCP, and use the port that was assigned to you (see the User Info page on the geni website to find out your port). In this step you should verify that all the hosts are able to connect to the hosts they are paired with.

== Step 3 : Flood connectivity information ==
----

From now on, we will refer to the hosts in your experiment as routers. In this step, these routers will re-construct the connectivity map of the entire network. To do this, you will need to create a simple protocol, using which a router can flood its connectivity information to its neighbors. A simple protocol for doing this would be to exchange strings such as "(router1 router2)" between two routers. Upon receiving such a string, each router forwards this string to its neighboring routers. One obvious problem with this protocol is that once generated, a message will be sent around forever. To stop messages from propagating, each message can include a time to live (TTL) value, so a message can look like "(router1 router2 TTL)". The TTL value will be decremented by each router before the router re-sends the message. Routers that generate initial messages can set the TTL value to be the number of routers in the system. A complementary way to deal with the problem of endless flooding is to prohibit routers from sending messages with information which they have already sent. In this way, only the newly updated routers will resend a message to its neighboring routers.

== Step 4 : Computing the routing path ==
----

In addition to building the global map of the network, each router will also need to perform shortest-path calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm. Maintaining an up-to-date routing table computed in this way enables the router to perform next-hop routing to forward a packet towards its destination.

[[BR]]
== Step 5 : Forwarding packets ==
----

Finally, each router needs to be able to route packets by using its routing table. To forward a packet, the router looks into its routing table for the destination address on the packet. From the routing table it retrieves the address of the router where it should forward the packet. It then forwards the packet to that router.
