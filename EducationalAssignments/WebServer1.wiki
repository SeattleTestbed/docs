3 Fishster
The third part of the assignment is to design and implement Fishster, a way of sharing files with
your classmates. As file sharing was the original motivation behind the Web, we build Fishster
using web protocols as a key building block. You will need to build:
•   Simple Web server. Your server should accept connections on the Transport port reserved
    for Fishster: port 80. For each arriving connection, it decodes the request using HTTP (see
    Peterson, Chapter 9.2.2). You should only support the very simplest form of “GET” re-
    quests, as in “GET index http/1.0<crlf> Host: ipaq-tom<crlf>”. The server then establishes
    another connection in the opposite direction, and if the file exists in the IPAQ’s “/www” di-
    rectory, sends the file to the other side, again using HTTP. Use only the simplest reply for-
    mat, e.g., “HTTP/1.0 202 Accepted<crlf><crlf><file contents>", or “HTTP/1.0 404 Not
    Found<crlf>” if the file doesn’t exist.
•   Fishster client. On the client side, the application should be able to connect to a remote web
    server running on an IPAQ at port 80. Instead of displaying the contents of the file (as in a
    normal web browser), your fishster client downloads all content that it doesn’t already have.
    The protocol to follow is that the file “index”, if it exists, contains a list of file names that the
    server is willing to share. Note that we are using HTTP/1.0, so that connections are terminated 
as soon as the file has been downloaded; another connection must be established to
download additional files. To avoid having every file downloaded over every hop multiple
times, the fishster client should only connect to web servers that are within one hop of the
client; provided the network stays up, all unique files will eventually end up on all nodes.
(This means that as you find and download files, you need to add them to your “index” file.)
As a test case, set up the file “index” to point to a file named your CSE login, and create a
file of that name with contents of your choice (e.g., a random #).
