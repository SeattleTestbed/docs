= Link State Routing Assignment =

This assignment will illustrate an important network routing strategy called Link State routing. In this assignment, Seattle nodes will take an initial connectivity map of nodes. They will then implement and run the Link State routing algorithm to build their routing tables.

This assignment consists of X steps and should take around Y minutes to complete. Let's begin!

Once you have acquired resources on the geni website, make a file containing the IP addresses of all the hosts you would like to include in the experiment, with one IP address per line. Then download, and run [attachment:build_connectivity_map.py build_connectivity_map] python script which will generate and output a list of IP pairs. You can then save this list to a file, and upload this file to all of your geni nodes in the experiment. Each Seattle host can then read this file on startup and connect to the hosts with which it is paired with.
