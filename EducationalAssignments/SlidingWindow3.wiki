= Sliding Window Protocol =

'''This page is under construction.'''

In this assignment, you will extend the [StopAndWaitAssignment Stop and Wait Assignment] with a sliding window algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm is to enable the sender to use the available network bandwidth more efficiently. This is done by sending more than one packet at a time before waiting to receive acknowledgements. This ''pipelining'' of packets makes for a much higher bandwidth communication protocol.

== Overview ==
----
The requirements for the assignment includes extensions to the [StopAndWaitAssignment Stop and Wait Assignment] library, along with a new set of client and server programs that stress-test your implementation by sending a lot of data.  Lastly, you will write up an evaluation of your implementation.

== What to turn in? ==
----

Turn in a tar file called "reliable.tar" that contains a directory called Reliable. This directory contains:
 * reliable.repy
 * reliable_server.repy
 * reliable_client.repy
 * results.pdf
 * README
The file results.pdf contains your evaluation. The file called README contains any information we might need in evaluating your solution. For example, bugs and limitations should be included in the README.
