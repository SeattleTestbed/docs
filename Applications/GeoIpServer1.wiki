= Running a GeoIP Server =

In order to allow geolocation lookups using the `geoip_client.repy` library, we have provided a GeoIP XML-RPC server for remote procedure call. While an instance of the server is running persistently at !http://geoip.cs.washington.edu:12679, the server program is available at `geoip_server/geoip_server.py`.

== Usage ==
{{{
$ python geoip_server.py /path/to/GeoIP.dat PORT
}}}

`geoip_server.py` requires the Python library [http://code.google.com/p/pygeoip/ pygeoip] and a valid !MaxMind geolocation database, such as [http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity GeoLite City]. The command-line arguments to geoip_server.py are the path to the GeoIP .dat file and the port on which to host the server.

Once the server is up and running, you can connect to it using the `geoip_client.repy` function `geoip_init_client()`, passing in the address (!http://HOSTNAME:PORT) of the server.
