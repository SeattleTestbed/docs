These graphs were compiled from data collected between February 24, 2011 and April 6, 2001. The data was collected using the [wiki:Libraries/ExperimentLibrary Experiment Library] to monitor the nodes advertising under the SeattleGENI node announcement public key. The monitoring script determined whether nodes were actually contactable by attempting to browse the node whenever is started or stopped advertising.
