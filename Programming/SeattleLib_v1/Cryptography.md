### Description

Seattle supports various cryptography choices. Since Seattle includes a lot of network communication, encrypting data is very important. This prevents 3rd party interference.

Many of the modules in this category are ported directly from Python equivalents, so it may be useful to view the documentation for those pages instead. All of those will be appropriately linked in their own sections.

Note also a few modules are very experimental in nature and may not have full functionality. All of these discrepancies will be noted as well per section.
