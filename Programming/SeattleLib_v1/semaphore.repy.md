# semaphore.repy

Although repy already contains a locking method, this module provides a level of abstraction by giving the end users the possibility of using semaphores. Though semaphores are slightly superior to locks, this module is not required to run anything. Using this purely at the programmer's discretion and need.

### Functions

```
def semaphore_create():
```
   Creates a new semaphore and return it to the user. Returns an unique semaphore handle.


```
def semaphore_destroy(semaphorehandle):
```
   Clean up a semaphore that is no longer needed. All currently blocked threads will be unblocked. All future uses of the semaphore will fail.

   Notes: 

   * semaphorehandle is the semaphore handle to destroy
   * Returns True if it cleaned up the semaphore handle, False if the handle was already cleaned up.


```
def semaphore_up(semaphorehandle):
```
   Increment a sempahore (possibly unblocking a thread)

   Notes: 

   * semaphorehandle is the semaphore handle generated by the create method.
   * Raises ValueError if the semaphorehandle is invalid.


```
def semaphore_down(semaphorehandle):
```
   Decrement a sempahore (possibly blocking this thread)

   Notes: 

   * semaphorehandle is the semaphore handle generated by the create method.
   * Raises ValueError if the semaphorehandle is invalid.
