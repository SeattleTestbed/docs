= safe_eval.repy =

Provides a method to safely evaluate a string. See usage for more information.


=== Functions === 


{{{
def safe_eval(code, context=None):
}}}
   Allows code to be safely evaluated.

   Notes:[[BR]]
   * code is the code to be evaluated.
   * context is the context to evaluate the code in. If not specified, an empty context is used.


=== Usage ===


{{{
    To perform the evaluation, a new entry '_result' is added into the
    context prior to execution and removed afterward. This will override any
    existing value. The code is evaluated by prepending '_result = ', so
    make sure the code still is sane after this. See safe_exec.

    As an example:
      val = safe_eval('123')
      print val # 123

      val = safe_eval('10 * 20 / 5')
      print val # 40

      val = safe_eval('print "Hi!"') # Exception, _result = print "Hi!" is not valid.
