= priority_queue.repy =

This module implements a Priority Queue class using a heap. Expected runtime: getMinimum: O(1), deleteMinimum: O(log n), and insert: O(log n).


=== Functions ===

{{{
def getMinimum(self):
}}}
   Gets the element with the minimum priority. Returns a tuple (priority, value). None if there are no nodes.


{{{
def insert(self, priority, value):
}}}
   Inserts a new node into the Priority Queue.

   Notes:
   * priority is the the priority for this new node.
   * value is the value to associate with this priority.


{{{
def deleteMinimum(self):
}}}
   Deletes and returns the element with the minimum priority. Returns a tuple (priority, value). None if there are no nodes.
