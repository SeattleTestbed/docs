= uniqueid.repy =

This is a simple module which provides an unique integer id for each function call. This exists to reduce redundancy in other libraries.

This service can be utilized directly, but is used in contexts like [wiki:SeattleLib/parallelize.repy].
	
NOTE: This will give unique ids PER FILE. If you have multiple python modules that include this, they will have the potential to generate the same ID.

{{{
def uniqueid_getid():
}}}
    Return a unique ID in a threadsafe way

=== Usage ===

{{{
request_id = uniqueid_getid();
