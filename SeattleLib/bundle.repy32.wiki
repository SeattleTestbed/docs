 = bundle.repy =
----
bundle.repy provides an utility for packaging multiple files into a single file.  This document describes usage via the '''Repy API'''.   For details on how to use it via the command line, go [wiki:SeattleLib/bundler.py here].

bundle.repy is designed with the intention to allow repy programmers to easily upload static files along with their repy programs.  You can write your program assuming that these files will be present in the local directory, bundle the said files into the program and then distribute it.  The extraction of these files is done for you, before execution.

Bundles are identified by a '''.bundle.repy''' extension.

== Repy API ==
----
The bundle is designed to be used directly by a repy program.  It exposes an object-oriented interface to manipulating bundles.
[[BR]]
=== bundle_bundle.!__init!__() ===
----
 Purpose::
  Creates a new bundle object.  Various bundle operations may then be performed.
 Arguments::
  '''bundlefn''' (str): Where the bundle is, or where to create it.  It must be in the current directory.[[br]]
  '''mode''' (str): 'r' for readonly, 'w' to create a new bundle, 'a' to modify an existing bundle.[[br]]
  '''srcfn''' (str/None)(optional): Only used if opening in 'w' mode.  If this is set, overwrite must be False.  The contents of this file will be included with the output bundle.[[br]]
  '''overwrite''' (bool) (optional): Only used if opening in 'w' mode.  Either this or overwrite may be specified.  If set to True, srcfn must be None.  The contents of the file referred to by bundlefn will be overwritten.  The original contents will be embedded in this new file.
 Side Effects::
  If opening in 'w' or 'a', the bundle will be created if it does not already exist in the current directory.
 Exceptions::
  None
 Returns::
  None
[[BR]]

----
 Purpose::
  Adds the specified file into the bundle.
 Arguments::
  '''fname''' (str): The name of the file to add to the bundle. [[br]]

  None
 Returns::
  None
[[BR]]
=== bundle_bundle.add_files() ===
----
 Purpose::
  Adds the specified files into the bundle.
 Arguments::
  '''fnames''' (list<str>): The names of the files to add to the bundle. [[br]]

== API Usage Example: Creating an Automated Experiment Script ==
----
Suppose you plan to use several hundred vessels to parse a two related data sets. You have the test script ('''experiment.repy''') written and ready for deployment. You have a script ('''generate_experiment.py''') that partitions the data into 1000 pairs ('''rawdataAXXX''', '''rawdataBXXX''') that the test script will utilize. The vessels will generate three types of output per update, '''UsageDataXXX_YYY''', '''PerformanceDataXXX_YYY''', and '''DatasetQualityXXX_YYY''', where XXX is the experiment #, and YYY is the update #. These vessels will periodically send the results back to the main server, so that not all data is lost if these vessels go down.

For this demonstration, we will work with generating chunk !#143.

[[BR]]
=== Creating a Data Bundle ===
----
In order to create an auto-extracting bundle, we must first instantiate a new Bundle, '''experiment143.bundle.repy'''. We will add this functionality to our generation script, '''generate_experiment.py'''.  There are two ways we can go about creating bundles, though only the first method is applicable for the current task:

{{{
#!repy
# We assume that the experiment doesn't already exist in the current directory.
experiment_bundle = bundle_bundle('experiment143.bundle.repy', 'w', source='experiment.repy')

# Not always the best idea, overwrite the original file.
experiment_bundle = bundle_bundle('experiment143.bundle.repy', 'w', overwrite=True)
}}}


[[BR]]
=== Adding Files to a Bundle ===
----
Now, we add the experiment data to the experiment script. These data elements are '''rawDataA143''' and '''rawDataB143'''.  For sake of demonstration, we assume that the data elements will be first written to files in the current directory, named '''rawDataA143''' and '''rawDataB143'''. We will bundle these files into '''experiment143.bundle.repy'''.

{{{
#!repy
# The filenames of the files to add
dataFnames = ['rawDataA143', 'rawDataB143']
experiment_bundle.add_files(dataFnames)
}}}


[[BR]]
=== Adding Strings to a Bundle ===
----
We will assume that you have a script that will acquire the vessels and start the experiment for you.  '''experiment143.bundle.repy''' will automatically extract the files that were bundled with it, and start executing. Now suppose that the experiment script is ready to dump its first set of data, '''parsed_usage_dataXXX_YYY''', '''parsed_performance_dataXXX_YYY''', and '''dataset_qualityXXX_YYY'''.  These datum are already in strings.  Additionally, we have already instantiated a bundle in the variable '''outputbundle'''.

{{{
#!repy
outputbundle.add_string('parsed_usage_data143_000', parsed_usage_data)
outputbundle.add_string('parsed_performance_data143_000', parsed_performance_data)
outputbundle.add_string('dataset_quality143_000', dataset_quality)
}}}

[[BR]]
=== Removing Elements from a Bundle ===
----
We donâ€™t have unlimited disk space on our vessel, so we prefer to overwrite our bundle instead of generating thousands of files. To do this, we will first remove our old bundled data, and then add the new strings into it. We will only demonstrate the removal of the data, as adding them back is done the same way as described above. Once again, the data elements in question are in the bundle with the filenames '''parsed_usage_dataXXX_YYY''', '''parsed_performance_dataXXX_YYY''', and '''dataset_qualityXXX_YYY'''.
{{{
#!repy
old_filenames = ['parsed_usage_data143_000', 'parsed_performance_data143_000', 'dataset_quality143_000']
outputbundle.remove_files(old_filenames)
}}}

[[BR]]
=== Checking a Bundleâ€™s Contents ===
----
Assume that we have a script that will fetch the parsed bundles and place them in the current directory. The collection service will periodically check the current directory for new updates, and extract the parsed data from them. Since we only need to retrieve data, weâ€™ll open this bundle in read-only mode. First we need to check the bundle contents to find which update this is.

{{{
#!repy
bundle_contents = obtainedbundle.contents()
}}}

Printing bundle_contents might produce the following output:
{{{
#!python
{'parsed_usage_data143_000': {'length': 623}, 'parsed_performance_data143_000': {'length': 1342}, 'dataset_quality143_000': {'length': 987231}}
}}}

[[BR]]
=== Reading Strings from a Bundle ===
----
Now, after we extracted the experiment # and update #, we can extract the actual data. The experiment # and update # are stored in '''experiment_number''' and '''update_number''', respectively.
{{{
#!python
parsed_usage_data = obtainedbundle.extract_string('parsed_usage_data143_000')
parsed_performance_data = obtainedbundle.extract_string('parsed_performance_data143_000')
dataset_quality = obtainedbundle.extract_string('dataset_quality143_000')
}}}

=== Extracting Files from a Bundle ===
In addition, we can also extract these files into files directly.
We can do them one by one...
{{{
#!python
fnames_to_extract = ['parsed_usage_data143_000', 'parsed_performance_data143_000', 'dataset_quality143_000']
obtainedbundle.extract_files(fnames_to_extract)
}}}

Or do them all simultaneously.
{{{
#!python
obtainedbundle.extract_all_files()
}}}


=== Clearing a Bundle / Original Source File Recovery ===
Now suppose you forgot to back up all your experiment data, and the only thing you have left is a experiment bundle '''experiment143.bundle.repy''' that you've previously deployed to a vessel, and you'd like to recover the original experiment script to the file '''experiment_copy.repy'''.  There are two ways to go about this:

{{{
#!repy
# Safe recovery, we save the results to an external file
bundle_clear_bundle_contents('experiment143.bundle.repy', 'experiment_copy.repy')

# Not always the best idea, we overwrite the original file
bundle_clear_bundle_contents('experiment143.bundle.repy', overwrite=True)

}}}
