= tcp_time.repy =

This module is an implementation of time_interface.repy

To use this module, make one call to time_updatetime() to get the time from the server. This function also implicitly sets the time. Then call time_gettime() every time the current time is needed.

=== Functions ===

{{{
tcp_time_updatetime(localport)
}}}
   Opens a connection with a server hosting time_server.repy, which obtains the current time via a NTP, then calls time_settime(float(currenttime)) to set the current time to the received value form the server. [[BR]]

   Notes:
   * Exception raised if advertise_lookup("time_server") fails after ten tries.
   * Exception raised when a connection is not able to be established with any of the servers running time_server.repy.
