=== Description ===

This section describes the all important tools necessary for dealing with sockets. For instance, we can use the modules in the section to find out critical information about vessels, which are elements that computers whose resources you can access ([wiki:getvesselsresources.repy]). We also have basic control over socket connections such as forcing hanging connections to quit ([wiki:sockettimeout.repy]). 

[wiki:nmclient.repy] is a also included here. It contains the backend to what could be an very useful external node manager.
