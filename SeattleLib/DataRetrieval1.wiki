=== Description ===

All the modules in category deal with data retrieval of some form. Since Seattle is a P2P based client, its often necessary to know about a specific  node: where it is, what is its IP address, etc. In addition to [wiki:domainnameinfo.repy], which simply returns the country of origin, Seattle also provides the [wiki:geoip_client.repy], which returns specific location information about the client, etc.

Seattle also provides a basic abstraction to the HTTP protocol, see [wiki:httpserver.repy].
