= repypp.py =

A preprocessor for repy.  It includes dependent files as needed. This is used to help the programmer avoid the need to use import. They
can instead use "include X" which works somewhat like "from X import *". 

Note "include" must be the first character on the line. (no indentation allowed!).

=== Functions ===

{{{
def processfiledata(stringlist):
}}}
   Scans lines with "include" and retrieves the correct module to be included.
 
 
{{{
def processfile(filename):
}}}
   Builds the correct file into a dictionary and returns the file's data.
 
 
{{{
def recursive_build_outdata(filename, includedfiles,filedict):
}}}
   Like above, but recursively builds and returns the data from file to be imported.

 
 

=== Usage ===


Note since this module essentially running in the background, an user can just use the keyword "include" and then any module in the Seattle Standard Library.
