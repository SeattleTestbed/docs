These services are used to protect transmission of data within the network. Encryption is also necessary in order to allow for serialization of the data, which is essential for data transmission as well. Programmers should take care to encrypt all their packets.

The Seattle Standard Library supports two different types of encoding methods: binary to ascii ([wiki:SeattleLibbinascii.repy]) and base64 ([wiki:SeattleLibbase64.repy]). The serialization module ([wiki:SeattleLib/serialize.repy]) allows for serialization and deserialization of various data types.
