= ntp_time.repy =

An implementation of [wiki:timeinterface.repy]

This module handles getting the time from an external source, via UDP. It gets the remote time once and then uses the offset from the local   clock from then on to return the current time.
	
To use this module:

1. Make a call to time_updatetime(localport) with a local UDP port that you have permission to send/recv on. This will contact some random subset of NTP servers to get and store the local time.	
2. Call time_gettime() which will return the current time (in seconds). 
3. time_gettime() can be called at any point after having called time_updatetime(localport) since time_gettime() simply calculates how much time has elapsed since the local time was originally acquired from one of the NTP servers.

=== Functions ===
{{{
ntp_time_updatetime(localport)
}}}
   Obtains and stores the local time from a subset of NTP servers. [[BR]]

   Notes:
   * localport is the local port used when connecting to NTP servers.
   * TimeError is raised if anything (NTP server, getip()) times out.
   * If time_gettime() fails, then time_updatetime(localport) can be called again to sample time from another random set of NTP servers.
