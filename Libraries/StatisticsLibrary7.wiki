== Statistics Library ==
This library is used to collect statistics about Seattle nodes/vessels and then run specific analysis on the group of data.

----
== Structure of a 'node_list' ==
 * Dictionary of Nodes, with keyword of its corresponding unique node id.  Contents of node id keyword is another dictionary with the following keywords:
   * '''timestamp''': a datetime object in the form of "datetime(2010, 2, 1, 22, 38, 21, 965646)", when the data was polled.
   * '''nodelocation''': 'ip:port'
   * '''responsetime''': a number in seconds corresponding to the time it took to run 'browse_node' (from the experiment library) on this specific node
   * '''version''': version of the node
   * '''nodeid''': unique node id of the node
   * '''vessels''': a list of vessel dictionaries (output of browse_node on the node) corresponding to the specific node
     * vesselhandle: 
     * vesselname: name of the vessel, ie. "v1"
     * ownerkey: 
     * nodelocation: 'ip:port'
     * userkeys: 
     * nodeid: unique node id of the node
     * version: version of the corresponding node
     * status: the status of the vessel at the time of polling

== Methods ==
 * '''poll_data'''()
   * Returns a collection of data relating to nodes/vessels and stores them into an external pickle (unparallelized completes in roughly 20min)
 * '''import_data'''(file_name)
   * Takes a file name (in pickle form) and returns a node_list
 * '''versions'''(node_list)
   * Returns a list of versions (strings) that exist in the current data
 * '''prod_beta_split'''(node_list)
   * Returns a list of 3 items: (1) list of production nodes, (2) list of beta nodes, (3) nodes with neither affiliation.
 * '''prod_beta_keys'''()
   * Returns a list of 2 items: (1) list of production keys and (2) list of beta keys
