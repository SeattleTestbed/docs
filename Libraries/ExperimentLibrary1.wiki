= Seattle Experiment Library =

The Experiment Library provides a means of scripting interaction with individual nodes and vessels as well as with SeattleGENI. Whereas [SeattleShell Seash] is for interactive use, the Experiment Library allows for writing Python scripts to acquire vessels, run experiments, download logs, etc.

= Getting the Experiment Library =

You can obtain the experiment library by running the following commands:

{{{
mkdir experimentlibrary
cd experimentlibrary
svn export https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/svn/seattle/trunk/experimentmanager
svn export https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/svn/seattle/trunk/seattlegeni/xmlrpc_clients/seattlegeni_xmlrpc.py
svn export https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/svn/seattle/trunk/seattlelib
rm -rf seattlelib/test seattlelib/tests
mv experimentmanager/* seattlelib/* ./
rmdir experimentmanager seattlelib
}}}

= Usage =

At the top of your own Python script add:

{{{
#!python
import sys
sys.path.append("/path/to/experimentlibrary")
import experimentlib
}}}

You can then use the Experiment Library in your script by calling the methods of the `experimentlib` module you imported.

All of the public constants, variables, and functions in `experimentlib.py` are meant to be used by your script. The private identifiers (the ones beginning with an underscore) should not need to be used by your script.

The comments at the top of `experimentlib.py` contain useful information about the data types and exceptions used by the Experiment Library. All of the public functions have comments to explain their usage. The examples/ directory that is in your experimentlibrary directory (if you performed the steps above) contains a handful of scripts that show different ways to use the Experiment Library.
