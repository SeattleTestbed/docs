This page describes which scripts need to automatically start on system boot and how to set them up.


[[TOC(inline)]]

== Overview ==
These scripts must be running '''at all times''' on both the production and beta Clearinghouses. They should be started as user root in a '''screen''' by running \seattlegeni\deploymentscripts\start_seattlegeni_components.sh which will automatically start the needed components.
 * lockserver_daemon.py 
 * backend_daemon.py
 * check_active_db_nodes.py
 * transition_donation_to_canonical
 * transition_canonical_to_twopercent
 * transition_twopercent_to_twopercent
 * transition_onepercentmanyevents_to_canonical

Currently we handle automatically starting these scripts on system boot with a cron job under root.  The following is the cron job for the beta Clearinghouse.
 {{{@reboot screen -S betaseattleclearinghouse -d -m /home/geni/start_seattlegeni_components.sh}}}
This can be set by 
 {{{$ sudo crontab -e}}}
and entering the following line in the text editor.  Be sure to enter the proper values for {{{clearinghouse_username}}} and {{{/path/to/start_seattlegeni_components.sh}}}.
 {{{@reboot screen -S clearinghouse_username -d -m /path/to/start_seattlegeni_components.sh}}}
