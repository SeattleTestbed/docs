= !SeattleBot: The Seattle IRC Bot =
!SeattleBot is an instance of {{{supybot}}} running on {{{seattle.cs}}} which logs the Freenode {{{#seattle}}} channel and provides information from Trac when tickets or changesets are mentioned.

'''Note:''' This service is not related to the IRC messages that will get posted by the [wiki:Local/MonitorProcessService Monitor Process Service] in the event of a service failure.


== Log storage ==
!SeattleBot is configured to log to {{{/home/seattlebot/logs/ChannelLogger/freenode/#seattle/}}} on {{{seattle.cs}}}. The logs can also be [https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/irclogs/ viewed online].


== Trac info in IRC ==
When a user in {{{#seattle}}} mentions ticket numbers or changeset numbers, !SeattleBot tries to grab relevant information from Trac and deliver it to the channel. For example, including the following text in a message should cause !SeattleBot to speak up:

{{{
#100
ticket 100
ticket:100
}}}

{{{
r200
changeset 200
changeset:200
}}}

See the regular expressions used in !SupyTrac/plugins.py for more specifics. Notably, single-digit tickets as well as single- and double-digit changesets are currently ignored.

== Installation Instructions ==

A user account on {{{seattle.cs}}} was created which has {{{supybot}}} installed from the Ubuntu repositories. Installation instructions are as follow:

{{{
mkdir /home/seattlebot/plugins
touch /home/seattlebot/plugins/__init__.py
cd /home/seattlebot/plugins
svn co http://svn.aminus.net/misc/supybot/plugins/SupyTrac/
}}}

In order to work with the installed version of Trac, the following changes were made to /home/seattlebot/plugins/SupyTrac/plugins.py:

All plugins besides !ChannelLog and !SupyTrac were disabled in the {{{/home/seattlebot/seattlebot.conf}}}. 

The following was added to {{{/etc/rc.local}}} to start {{{supybot}}} on startup:

{{{
sudo -u seattlebot supybot /home/seattlebot/seattlebot.conf >>/home/seattlebot/stdout-stderr.log 2>&1 &

To make the logs available through the website, the following was added to /etc/apache2/sites-available/default's https vhost:
