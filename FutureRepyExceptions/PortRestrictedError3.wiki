In the FutureRepyExceptionHierarchy, PortRestrictedError occurs when repy programs attempt to bind to ports that are restricted. This can be because the local port is invalid when connecting to a remote host; because the remote port is invalid when connecting to a remote host; or because the local port is invalid when listening for incoming connections. (In the previous, "connecting" can be replaced with "sending messages" and "connection" with "messages" for UDP datagrams.)

Conrad: We don't care about the remote port when they are connecting to us, right?
