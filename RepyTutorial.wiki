== Introduction ==
----

This guide provides an introduction to using the Repy sandbox environment.  It describes what restrictions are placed upon the sandboxed code with examples. At the end of reading this document you should be able to write Repy programs, manage the restrictions on programs, and understand whether Repy is appropriate for a specific task or program.

It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of network programming such as socket, ports, IP addresses, and etc.  Also, a basic understanding of HTML is useful but not required.  Lastly, you need a basic understanding of the Python programming language.  If not, you might want to first read through the Python tutorial at http://www.python.org/doc/ or the [PythonTutorial python tutorial] in this site. You do not need to be a Python expert to use Repy, but as Repy is a subset of Python, being able to write a simple Python program is essential.

[[BR]]
== General Operations with examples ==
----
You have to install Repy before starting the tutorial.
You can download Repy [https://seattleclearinghouse.poly.edu/download/flibble/ here].   

If you want you can look at the installer options using the {{{--usage}}} option.   You can also simply install the software using the defaults.

There is the link to file used in each section next to the title and also at the bottom of this tutorial.
Here is [raw-attachment:example.zip link] to the zip file containing all files used in this tutorial.
All attached files work on Windows systems.

=== File execution (example 1.1) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/restrictions.test restrictions.test], [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.1.1.repy example.1.1.repy]
----

Let's start with the file named "example.1.1.repy", which prints the string "Hello World".
We use repy instead of py as the file extension for files in Repy.

{{{
#!python
if callfunc == 'initialize':
    print "Hello World"
}}}

There are two different ways to run Repy programs.
You can run the code in your local machine and in the VMs you control.

[[BR]]
==== Executing programs locally in Repy ====
----

===== Advanced Instructions =====
To run a repy program from the command line, run the following with the correct values substituted in:

{{{
python <path to repy.py> <path to restrictions file> <path to source file>
}}}

For example, if your current working directory is the location where repy is installed, restrictions.test is in "C:\seattle\examples\restrictions.test", and your source file is  "C:\seattle\examples\example.1.1.repy", you can run the repy program with the following command:

{{{
#!python
python repy.py "C:\seattle\examples\restrictions.test" "C:\seattle\examples\example.1.1.repy"
}}}



===== Interactive Testing =====
To use repy functions from an interactive python interpreter, you can open Python and map the symbols from repyportability into your namespace.   For example, to get a randomfloat through repy, do:

{{{
Justin-Capposs-MacBook-Pro:test2 justincappos$ python
Python 2.7.1 (r271:86832, Jun 16 2011, 16:59:05) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from repyportability import *
>>> randomfloat()
0.18776749685771188
}}}

Note that this will not provide the security and performance isolation from Repy.   As a result, you can also do things that are not allowed in Repy.



===== Basic Instructions =====

First, make sure that you have the repy files [https://seattleclearinghouse.poly.edu/download/flibble/ (download)] and [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/restrictions.test restrictions.test] in your seattle_repy directory. 

Install repy by running the relevant installer. For windows, it is "install.bat".

Then open a command prompt (Windows) or shell (Unix) and change to the seattle_repy directory in the installer.   Execute the following command to run the example program listed above.   (Note that you can download the example.1.1.repy file and all other example files from this [raw-attachment:examples.zip link]).


{{{
#!python
python repy.py restrictions.test example.1.1.repy
}}}


The output is the following:

{{{
#!python
Hello World
Terminated
}}}

"Hello World" was printed, and then the last sentence means that the program was terminated successfully. 

Not all users will see "Terminated". This only shows up on some operating systems. Other operating systems may have different messages.

[[BR]]
==== Executing programs remotely in VMs ====
----

You can also access the resources donated to you and run the program example.1.1.repy in the resources you can control. You need to follow the steps below in the shell in order to  run the program in resources.

'''Step 1. Run programs in the Seattle 

To run a program, you should use the experiment manager seash. Seash allows you to control the files running in sandboxes you control.

{{{
#!python
python seash.py
}}}

'''Step 2. Log in with your key

Before logging in, you have to load your public and private keys. You can get the keys at the  [https://seattleclearinghouse.poly.edu/ SeattleClearinghouse] website. You need to make sure that you have two files, your public and private key. The name of each file is your ID and the extension of files are publickey and privatekey.
For example, if your ID were john, the two files would be {{{john.publickey}}} and {{{john.privatekey}}}.   These files must be placed in the directory where you run {{{seash}}}.

If you successfully logged in, you could notice that the prompt starts with you ID.

{{{
#!python
!> loadkeys john
!> as john
john@ !>
}}}

'''Step 3. Locate the resources(computers) you can use

This command will tell the shell to locate resources that have been assigned to your account through the !SeattleClearinghouse website. In order to assign resources to your account, you must go to the !SeattleClearinghouse website, log into your account and get more resources under the 'My VMs' tab.

{{{
#!python
john@ !> browse

Added targets: %1(10.0.1.1:1224:v9), %2(10.0.1.2:2888:v9)

Added group 'browsegood' with 2 targets

The command browse produced the output that shows resources(targets) you can control. 
}}}

In the first target %1(10.0.1.1:1224:v9), %1 is the alias of the target, 10.0.1.1 is IP address, 1224 is port number, and v9 is VM name. The VM is the partial portion of whole donated resources. It means that the donated resources could be one VM or divided and assigned to more than one person. 

'''Step 4. Access the resources(VMs)

{{{
#!python
john@ !> on browsegood
}}}

'''Step 5. Run a program

In this case, the program named example.1.1.repy is stored in the current directory. Note that the results will not be printed.

{{{
#!python
john@browsegood !> run example.1.1.repy
}}}

'''Step 6. Look up the result of the program executed

In order to see the output, run 'show log', as is done below:

{{{
#!python
john@browsegood !> show log

Log from '10.0.1.1:1224:v9':
Hello World

Log from '10.0.1.2:2888:v9':
Hello World
}}}

'''Step 7. Look up the information about the VMs you control

{{{
#!python
john@browsegood !> list

ID Own       Name          Status          Owner Information
%1  *   10.0.1.1:1224:v9 Terminated                               
%2  *   10.0.1.2:2888:v9 Terminated        
}}}

'''Step 8. Exit from Seash

{{{
#!python
john@browsegood !> exit
}}}

You can find more practical examples in the [EducationalAssignments/TakeHome Take home assignment] page.

=== A Hello World example (example 1.2) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.1.2.repy example.1.2.repy]
----

In this example, we'll wait for the user to browse a port we listen on. When the user browses our page, we'll display a hello world webpage and then exit. 

{{{
#!python
def hello(ip,port,sockobj, thiscommhandle,listencommhandle):
  sockobj.recv(512) # Receive HTTP header

  htmlresponse = "<html><head><title>Hello World</title></head>" + \
    "<body><h1> Hello World! </h1></body></html>"
  
  sockobj.send("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-type: text/html\r\n" + \
    "Content-length: %i\r\n\r\n%s" % (len(htmlresponse), htmlresponse))

  stopcomm(thiscommhandle)   
  # close my connection with this user (we could also do sockobj.close())

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  if len(callargs) > 1:
    raise Exception("Too many call arguments")

  # Running remotely:
  # whenever this vessel gets a connection on its IPaddress:GENIport it'll call hello
  elif len(callargs) == 1:
    port = int(callargs[0])
    ip = getmyip()

  # Running locally:
  # whenever we get a connection on 127.0.0.1:12345 we'll call hello
  else:
    port = 12345
    ip = '127.0.0.1'
  listencommhandle = waitforconn(ip,port,hello)

}}}

The initialize portion has two options.  If you run it locally, it says, wait for a connection on 127.0.0.1 (the "local" IP of the computer), port 12345, and when you get, it calls the function hello().

{{{
127.0.0.1 is a special IP address. 
It is localhost and means this computer. It is used to access the computer currently used.
}}}

Otherwise, you're running it remotely and need to pass it your Clearinghouse port.  For convenience, Seattle Clearinghouse assigns the same UDP port to all of a user's VMs. To figure out which port you should use, log into the SeattleClearinghouse website and on the Profile page, look to see what port number it indicates. You'll see a page like below.

[[Image(clearinghouseport.png)]]

You should write your Clearinghouseport down as you'll need this value repeatedly.

The waitforconn() function returns a commhandle. A commhandle is a way for your program to refer to a connection. You can pass a commhandle to other functions to do operations. For example, when you want to close a connection you can call stopcomm with the commhandle for the connection that should be closed.
{{{
waitforconn(IP address, Port number, Callback function)

IP address : IP address to listen on 
Port number : The port to bind to
Callback function : Callback function to be executed whenever a TCP connection is made to that IP/port

}}}
To read more about waitforconn(), visit the [wiki:RepyApi#waitforconnlocaliplocalportfunction API]


The function hello sends the webpage (the text in quotes) using the sockobj and then closes the current connection (using the commhandle).
{{{ 
hello(IP address, Port number, Socket Object, commhandle1, commhandle2)

The ip address and port : the users are connecting to.
Socket Object : End-point of a bidirectional communication flow across the Internet.
Commhandle1 : Handle created by connection
Commhandle2 : Handle created for establishing connection, which hello is registered on

In the Berkeley sockets API in the C language, 
Commhandle1 is the new socket created by accept function,
and commhadle2 is initial socket created by socket function.
}}}

'''Running locally

To run this program locally, you can type like below.

{{{
#!python
python repy.py restrictions.test example.1.2.repy
}}}

Then open a web browser and in the address bar type: 127.0.0.1:12345  (this says to navigate to the "local" IP of the computer at port 12345).   You should see the hello world webpage.

To stop the program, press CTRL-C.

'''Running remotely

Open seash the same as in the previous example but choose a single VM.

{{{
#!python
default@ !> on %1  
default@%1 !>
}}}

Then, run this program passing it your Clearinghouse port.

{{{
#!python
default@%1 !> run example.1.2.repy Clearinghouseport
default@%1 !> list                            
  ID   Own                  Name                Status      Owner Information
  %1             IP address:port:VMname     Started     
}}}

Notice that the program is "Started" instead of "Terminated". It's still running! 

Now open a web browser and in the address bar type: IP_of_%1:Clearinghouseport.  For example, if 1.2.3.4 is the IP address of %1, and your port is 54321 then open your browser and in the address bar type "http://1.2.3.4:54321". If the node doesn't respond, try again.    You should see the hello world webpage.

To stop the program, in the shell type:

{{{
#!python
default@%1 !> stop  # This will stop any programs that are still running...  
default@%1 !> list                          
  ID    Own                Name                Status          Owner Information
  %1             IP address:port:VMname    Stopped   
}}}

Notice that the program is now "Stopped".   It's not running

=== Counting the number of calls (example 1.3) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.1.3.repy example.1.3.repy]
----

In this example, we'll add a counter to our helloworld program.   First we'll try some perfectly valid python code that will not work in Repy.

{{{
#!python
def hello(ip,port,sockobj, thiscommhandle,listencommhandle):
  sockobj.recv(512) # Receive HTTP header

  global pagecount   # GLOBALS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN REPY
  pagecount = pagecount + 1

  htmlresponse = "<html><head><title>Hello World</title></head>" + \
    "<body><h1> Hello World!</h1><p>You are visitor " + \
    str(mycontext['pagecount']) + "</p></body></html>"

  sockobj.send("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-type: text/html\r\n" + \
    "Content-length: %i\r\n\r\n%s" % (len(htmlresponse), htmlresponse))

  stopcomm(thiscommhandle)   # close my connection with this user

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  global pagecount   # GLOBALS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN REPY
  pagecount = 0
  
  if len(callargs) > 1:
    raise Exception("Too many call arguments")

  # Running remotely:
  # whenever this vessel gets a connection on its IPaddress:GENIport it'll call hello
  elif len(callargs) == 1:
    port = int(callargs[0])
    ip = getmyip()

  # Running locally:
  # whenever we get a connection on 127.0.0.1:12345 we'll call hello
  else:
    port = 12345
    ip = '127.0.0.1'
  listencommhandle = waitforconn(ip,port,hello)

}}}

This code will not work because globals do not exist in Repy. However, there is a mycontext dictionary provided for this purpose.   The code can be written as follows:

{{{
#!python
def hello(ip,port,sockobj, thiscommhandle,listencommhandle):
  sockobj.recv(512) # Receive HTTP header
  mycontext['pagecount'] = mycontext['pagecount'] + 1

  htmlresponse = "<html><head><title>Hello World</title></head>" + \
    "<body><h1> Hello World!</h1><p>You are visitor " + \
    str(mycontext['pagecount']) + "</p></body></html>"

  sockobj.send("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-type: text/html\r\n" + \
    "Content-length: %i\r\n\r\n%s" % (len(htmlresponse), htmlresponse))

  stopcomm(thiscommhandle)   # close my connection with this user

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  mycontext['pagecount'] = 0
  
  if len(callargs) > 1:
    raise Exception("Too many call arguments")

  # Running remotely:
  # whenever this vessel gets a connection on its IPaddress:GENIport it'll call hello
  elif len(callargs) == 1:
    port = int(callargs[0])
    ip = getmyip()

  # Running locally:
  # whenever we get a connection on 127.0.0.1:12345 we'll call hello
  else:
    port = 12345
    ip = '127.0.0.1'
  listencommhandle = waitforconn(ip,port,hello)

}}}

Start the program using the shell, then open a web browser and in the address bar type: IP_of_VM:Clearinghouseport.  You should see the hello world webpage and a count of 1. You can refresh the page and the count should increment.   Once again,use the shell to stop the program

[[BR]]
=== Adding a Timer and listing the elapsed time (example 1.4) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.1.4.repy example.1.4.repy]
----

The previous program would run forever, waiting for a user to connect so it could display a webpage.   What if you wanted the program to stop running after 1 minute?   To do this, we'll register a timer that will close the connection.

{{{
#!python
def hello(ip,port,sockobj, thiscommhandle,listencommhandle):
  sockobj.recv(512) # Receive HTTP header
  mycontext['pagecount'] = mycontext['pagecount'] + 1

  htmlresponse = "<html><head><title>Hello World</title></head>" + \
    "<body><h1> Hello World!</h1><p>You are visitor " + \
    str(mycontext['pagecount']) + "</p><p>I've been running " + \
    str(getruntime())+" seconds</p></body></html>"

  sockobj.send("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-type: text/html\r\n" + \
    "Content-length: %i\r\n\r\n%s" % (len(htmlresponse), htmlresponse))

  stopcomm(thiscommhandle)   # close my connection with this user
 
def stop_listening(commhandle):
  stopcomm(commhandle)   # this will deregister hello

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  mycontext['pagecount'] = 0
  
  if len(callargs) > 1:
    raise Exception("Too many call arguments")

  # Running remotely:
  # whenever this vessel gets a connection on its IPaddress:GENIport it'll call hello
  elif len(callargs) == 1:
    port = int(callargs[0])
    ip = getmyip()

  # Running locally:
  # whenever we get a connection on 127.0.0.1:12345 we'll call hello
  else:
    port = 12345
    ip = '127.0.0.1'
  listencommhandle = waitforconn(ip,port,hello)
  
  # wait 60 seconds, then call stop_listening with listencommhandle
  eventhandle = settimer(60, stop_listening, (listencommhandle,)) 
   
}}}
 
The timer (when called) will stop the communication. settimer returns an eventhandle. An eventhandle is similar to a commhandle in that it can be used to interact with an event. listencommhandle is not the arguments of settimer but that of stop_listening. The comma next to stop_listening and parentheses surrounding listencommhandle indicate that.

getruntime() is used to provide the amount of time that has elapsed since the program was started.   Note that it may be possible for the elapsed time to be > 60 seconds in this program because there may be some lag between when the program started and when your code ran or a delay in running the stop_listening event.

Start the program and then open a web browser and in the address bar type: IPaddress_of_VM:Clearinghouseport.  You'll notice that the webpage displays and after 1 minute the program will stop listening and stop itself.   You'll see that the program's status is "Terminated" because it caused itself to exit (as opposed to "Stopped" where you stopped it while it was running).

[[BR]]
=== Interacting with Timers (example 1.5) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.1.5.repy example.1.5.repy]
----

We know how to set a timer to close the connection in 60 seconds, but that doesn't help us to keep the connection open. To have the connection kept open while requests continue to happen, every time we get a request we'll cancel the existing timer and set a new timer for 10 seconds in the future that will close the connection. The timer(when called) will stop the communication. canceltimer stops a timer (if it hasn't already started).

[[Image(SetTimer.jpg)]]

{{{
#!python
def hello(ip,port,sockobj, thiscommhandle,listencommhandle):
  sockobj.recv(512) # Receive HTTP header
  mycontext['pagecount'] = mycontext['pagecount'] + 1

  htmlresponse = "<html><head><title>Hello World</title></head>" + \
    "<body><h1> Hello World!</h1><p>You are visitor " + \
    str(mycontext['pagecount']) + "</p></body></html>"

    "Content-length: %i\r\n\r\n%s" % (len(htmlresponse), htmlresponse))

  stopcomm(thiscommhandle)   # close my connection with this user

  # stop the previous timer...
  canceltimer(mycontext['stopevent'])
  
  # start a new one for 10 seconds from now...
  eventhandle = settimer(10, stop_listening, (listencommhandle,))
  mycontext['stopevent'] = eventhandle
 
def stop_listening(commhandle):
  stopcomm(commhandle)   # this will deregister hello

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  mycontext['pagecount'] = 0

  if len(callargs) > 1:
    raise Exception("Too many call arguments")

  # Running remotely:
  # whenever this vessel gets a connection on its IPaddress:GENIport it'll call hello
  elif len(callargs) == 1:
    port = int(callargs[0])
    ip = getmyip()

  # Running locally:
  # whenever we get a connection on 127.0.0.1:12345 we'll call hello
  else:

  listencommhandle = waitforconn(ip,port,hello)

  eventhandle = settimer(10, stop_listening, (listencommhandle,))
  mycontext['stopevent'] = eventhandle

}}}

Try running the program and then try browsing the webpage a few times and then wait. You'll notice the connection closes 10 seconds after you stop browsing.

=== Races, Sleep, and Locks (example 1.6) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.1.6.repy example.1.6.repy]
----

The wily reader may have noticed that the previous program has a race condition. It is possible to have multiple browser windows browse 127.0.0.1 at the same time. It is possible for browser window A to cancel the timer, but before it adds the new eventhandle to mycontext!['stopevent'], window B could also try to cancel the timer and set up its own event. Now there are two events that will stop communications and only one of these will be listed in mycontext!['stopevent']. This means that regardless of how often a user views the webpages, the other event will fire because there is no reference to the eventhandle. The connection will be closed (not what we want!). It would be difficult to trigger this condition manually, but we'll use a command "sleep" to pause the current function for some amount of time to allow us to trigger the bug so that we can see it in practice.

  # wait 10 seconds, then call stop_listening with listencommhandle
  eventhandle = settimer(10, stop_listening, (listencommhandle,)) 
  
  mycontext['stopevent'] = eventhandle
}}}
 
Try browsing the webpage a few times rapidly and then browse every 3-5 seconds.   You'll notice the program closes automatically even though it shouldn't (because you kept browsing).  

One way to fix a race condition is using a lock. You can get a lock by calling getlock(). A lock supports two operations: acquire and release and is similar to the Python threading Lock class.

We can avoid race conditions by the following changes:

{{{
#!python
def hello(ip,port,sockobj, thiscommhandle,listencommhandle):
  sockobj.recv(512) # Receive HTTP header
  mycontext['pagecount'] = mycontext['pagecount'] + 1

  htmlresponse = "<html><head><title>Hello World</title></head>" + \
    "<body><h1> Hello World!</h1><p>You are visitor " + \
    str(mycontext['pagecount']) + "</p></body></html>"

  sockobj.send("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-type: text/html\r\n" + \
    "Content-length: %i\r\n\r\n%s" % (len(htmlresponse), htmlresponse))
  stopcomm(thiscommhandle)   # close my connection with this user

  mycontext['stoplock'].acquire() # acquire the lock

  canceltimer(mycontext['stopevent'])

  # wait 10 seconds, then call stop_listening with listencommhandle
  eventhandle = settimer(10, stop_listening, (listencommhandle,)) 
  
  mycontext['stopevent'] = eventhandle

  mycontext['stoplock'].release() # release the lock
 
def stop_listening(commhandle):
  stopcomm(commhandle)   # this will deregister hello

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  mycontext['pagecount'] = 0
  mycontext['stoplock'] = getlock()
  
  if len(callargs) > 1:
    raise Exception("Too many call arguments")

  # Running remotely:
  # whenever this vessel gets a connection on its IPaddress:GENIport it'll call hello
  elif len(callargs) == 1:
    port = int(callargs[0])
    ip = getmyip()

  # Running locally:
  # whenever we get a connection on 127.0.0.1:12345 we'll call hello
  else:
    port = 12345
    ip = '127.0.0.1'
  listencommhandle = waitforconn(ip,port,hello)
  
  # wait 10 seconds, then call stop_listening with listencommhandle
  eventhandle = settimer(10, stop_listening, (listencommhandle,)) 
  
  mycontext['stopevent'] = eventhandle
}}}

Now if you run the program repeatedly, it shouldn't be possible to trigger a race condition.   Note that since only one event can be in the section of the code protected with locks, if you put a sleep in there and rapidly browse, you may have your program slow down because there are not enough free threads / events.  

Race conditions can happen with threads created by several different functions including waitforconn, recvmess, and settimer.   Remember that any callbacks or timers may be executing at the same time as your other code.   If you need to prevent multiple threads from modifying a variable or executing a piece of code at the same time, use a lock!

=== Introduction to Files (example 2.1) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.2.1.repy example.2.1.repy], [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/hello.file hello.file]
----

We'll now switch gears from our hello world web server and focus instead on writing data to files.   The first program we'll write the string "hello world" to a file and then read it back out and print it.

{{{
#!python
if callfunc == 'initialize':
  
  # just like python's open() function
  myfileobject = open("hello.file","w")   
  
  # we also could have used myfileobject.write("hello world\n")
  print >> myfileobject, "hello world"     
    
  myfileobject.close()

  # we can use file instead of open.   They work the same...
  newfileobject = file("hello.file","r")   
  
  print newfileobject.read()
  newfileobject.close()
}}}

This program should print hello world (and an extra newline from print). The Repy file object is similar to python's file object so you can do things like:

{{{
#!python
for line in file("hello.file","r"):
  # code here
  ...
}}}

[[BR]]
=== Listing and Removing Files (example 2.2) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.2.2.repy example.2.2.repy]
----

In this example, we'll change our program to write information to a few different files and after we're finished, we'll remove the files.   Instead of coding in the program which files to write information to, we'll let our command line arguments specify which files to write.

{{{
#!python
if callfunc == 'initialize':
  for filename in callargs:   # callargs has all of the command line arguments in it.
    
    # just like python's open() function
    myfileobject = open(filename,"w")   
   
    # we also could have used myfileobject.write("hello world\n")
    print >> myfileobject, "hello world"
    
    myfileobject.close()

  # now we'll go through and print the files in this directory
  # (it may include things other than our files).
  print listdir()
  
  for filename in callargs:   # let's remove our files now...
    removefile(filename)  

  print "The files:",callargs," should now be missing from ",listdir()  
}}}

You should see output that first lists the file names in the current directory (along with the files you chose to write) and then shows the listing missing the files.   Note that if you choose file names with characters like "/", "\", "@", or other non-alphanumeric characters you will get an error because Repy programs are not allowed to use certain characters in file names.

=== Interacting with other computers (example 3.1)  ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.3.1.repy example.3.1.repy]
----

In this example, we'll retrieve a webpage and print it on the screen.   We're not going to translate all of the HTML or remove the HTTP headers, so it will be a bit messy.  

{{{
#!python
if callfunc == 'initialize':
 
  # open a connection to the google web server
  socketobject = openconn("www.google.com",80)    
  
  # this is a HTTP request...
  socketobject.send("GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.google.com\r\n\r\n")
 
  while True:
     print socketobject.recv(4096)

}}}
   
You should see google's webpage along with some numbers and other information (this is the HTTP protocol).   However, the program does not stop (at least until you press CTRL-C)!   This is because HTTP 1.1 allows us to issue multiple page requests on a single connection.  

[[BR]]
=== Causing a program to exit (example 3.2) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.3.2.repy example.3.2.repy]
----

In this example, we'll change the previous program to exit after we receive the data from google.   To do this we'll use a function called exitall().   This function causes the program to abort and all threads to exit immediately.   We can add this to a timer to the previous example as follows:

{{{
#!python
if callfunc == 'initialize':

  # open a connection to the google web server
  socketobject = openconn("www.google.com",80)   
  
  # this is a HTTP request...
  socketobject.send("GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.google.com\r\n\r\n")

  # We'll loop and print information from google. 
  # We don't "speak" HTTP, so we'll set a timer to exit in 3 seconds
  settimer(3, exitall, ())
  
  while True:
     print socketobject.recv(4096)
}}}
 
Alternatively, we could instead close the socket and check this condition.   Example code that shows this is below

{{{
#!python
if callfunc == 'initialize':

  # open a connection to the google web server
  socketobject = openconn("www.google.com",80) 
  
  # this is a HTTP request...
  socketobject.send("GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.google.com\r\n\r\n") 
  
  # We'll loop and print information from google. 
  # We don't "speak" HTTP, so we'll set a timer to close the socket in 3 seconds
  settimer(3, socketobject.close, ())

  while True:
     try:
       print socketobject.recv(4096)
     except Exception, e:    # we got an exception. Did they close the socket?
       if str(e) != "Socket closed":
         raise
       break
}}}

=== Looking up IP addresses (example 4.1) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.4.1.repy example.4.1.repy]
----

In this example, we'll look up some IP addresses using gethostname_ex:

{{{
#!python
if callfunc == 'initialize':
  print gethostbyname_ex("www.google.com")
  print gethostbyname_ex("www.wikipedia.com")
  print getmyip()
}}}

This will print IP address, hostname and other information for google and wikipedia and will also print the current computer's IP address.   For more information about the format of the data returned from gethostbyname_ex see the [wiki:RepyApi#gethostbyname_exname RepyApi].

=== Sending and receiving messages (example 4.2) ===
[https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1/blob/master/apps/example/example.4.2.repy example.4.2.repy]
----

In this example, we'll manually send a NTP (time) lookup message and print the raw data that is returned.   Rather than hard code a server into our program, we'll randomly choose a server from a list of publicly available time servers.   A lot of the complexity in this program comes with encoding and decoding NTP data.  


{{{
#!python
# See RFC 2030 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2030.txt) for details about NTP

# this unpacks the data from the packet and changes it to a float
def convert_timestamp_to_float(timestamp):   
  integerpart = (ord(timestamp[0])<<24) + (ord(timestamp[1])<<16)
                 + (ord(timestamp[2])<<8) + (ord(timestamp[3]))
  floatpart = (ord(timestamp[4])<<24) + (ord(timestamp[5])<<16)
               + (ord(timestamp[6])<<8) + (ord(timestamp[7]))
  return integerpart + floatpart / float(2**32)

def decode_NTP_packet(ip, port, mess, ch):
  print "From "+str(ip)+":"+str(port)+", I received NTP data."
  print "NTP Reference Identifier:",mess[12:16]
  print "NTP Transmit Time (in seconds since Jan 1st, 1900):", convert_timestamp_to_float(mess[40:48])
  stopcomm(ch)

if callfunc == 'initialize':
  ip = getmyip()
  timeservers = ["time-a.nist.gov", "time-b.nist.gov", "time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov", 
                 "time-b.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov", "time-c.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov", 
                 "utcnist.colorado.edu", "time.nist.gov", "time-nw.nist.gov", 
                 "nist1.symmetricom.com", "nist1-dc.WiTime.net", "nist1-ny.WiTime.net", 
                 "nist1-sj.WiTime.net", "nist.expertsmi.com", "nist.netservicesgroup.com"]

  # choose a random time server from the list
  servername = timeservers[int(randomfloat()*len(timeservers))]
  print "Using: ", servername

  # this sends a request, version 3 in "client mode"
  ntp_request_string = chr(27)+chr(0)*47
  recvmess(ip,12345, decode_NTP_packet)
  sendmess(servername,123, ntp_request_string, ip, 12345) # port 123 is used for NTP
}}}

This will print the number of seconds since Jan 1st, 1900 from a time server. If you run the program multiple times, you'll see it chooses servers randomly from the timeservers list.  

One thing to note, connection functions like opencomm and waitforcomm use different ports (TCP) than message functions like sendmess and recvmess (UDP).  

Getting the time from a synchronized time source is a handy thing to do (so this isn't bad code to repurpose for your code).   You shouldn't ask for the time repeatedly from the time servers though (they consider requests more frequent than 4 seconds apart to be a DoS attack).   You can ask once for a global reference time and then use getruntime to measure the elapsed time.

[[BR]]
== Restrictions ==
----

In the previous examples, we've been running code on our local system which we have control over.   When deploying Repy programs, you may instead end up running your code on systems that don't belong to you.   Since you don't control these systems, the users are likely to have a set of restrictions on what you can do on their computer.   You may be unable to write files to disk, not be able to send packets to certain IP addresses, or prevented from performing operations.  

To get a restriction / restrictions file, in the shell type: show resources.   If you look at a restrictions file, you'll see a bunch of lines like this (ignore the resource lines for now):

{{{
#!python
call sendmess allow
call stopcomm allow                     # it doesn't make sense to restrict
call recvmess allow
call openconn allow
call waitforconn allow
call socket.close allow                 # let's not restrict
call socket.send allow                  # let's not restrict
call socket.recv allow                  # let's not restrict

# open and file.__init__ both have built in restrictions...
call open arg 0 is junk_test.out allow  # can write to junk_test.out
call open arg 1 is r allow              # allow an explicit read
call open noargs is 1 allow             # allow an implicit read
call file.__init__ arg 0 is junk_test.out allow # can write to junk_test.out
call file.__init__ arg 1 is r allow     # allow an explicit read
call file.__init__ noargs is 1 allow    # allow an implicit read
call file.close allow                   # shouldn't restrict
call file.flush allow                   # they are free to use
call file.next allow                    # free to use as well...
call file.read allow                    # allow read
call file.readline allow                # shouldn't restrict
call file.readlines allow               # shouldn't restrict
call file.seek allow                    # seek doesn't restrict
call file.write allow                   # shouldn't restrict (open restricts)
call file.writelines allow              # shouldn't restrict (open restricts)
call sleep allow                        # harmless
call settimer allow                     # we can't really do anything smart
call canceltimer allow                  # should be okay
call exitall allow                      # should be harmless
call log.write allow                    # allows printing to the log
call log.writelines allow               # a different format of printing to the log
call getmyip allow                      # They can get the external IP address
call listdir allow                      # They can list the files they created
call removefile allow                   # They can remove the files they create
call randomfloat allow                  # can get random numbers
call getruntime allow                   # can get the elapsed time
call getlock allow                      # can get a lock
}}}

These lines specify which functions the program is allowed to call.   They may also list the arguments that can be passed.   When you create a program, you should decide which actions it needs to perform.   It is easier for you to locate computers you can run on if your program has fewer requirements.   You can specify that a function can only be called with a certain number of arguments or certain arguments.   This can be helpful to restrict your program to use certain filenames or functions.  

[[BR]]
== Resources ==
----

In the previous section, we looked at restrictions; a mechanism for allowing or denying an action.   These aren't adequate for many cases.   For example, you can say a program can or cannot write files, but you cannot say that a program can only write 1MB worth of files.   This is where resources come in.   They put limits on the number of resources a program can consume.

If you look at a restrictions / resources file, you'll see a bunch of lines like this:

{{{
#!python
resource cpu .10
resource memory 10000000   # 10 Million bytes
resource diskused 10000000 # 10 MB
resource events 10
resource filewrite 10000
resource fileread 10000
resource filesopened 5
resource insockets 5
resource outsockets 5
resource netsend 10000
resource netrecv 10000
resource loopsend 1000000
resource looprecv 1000000
resource lograte 30000
resource random 100
resource messport 12345
resource messport 12346
resource connport 12345
}}}

These lines specify the type and quantity of resources the program can consume.   Some resources like CPU, the netsend / recv rate, random number generation rate, etc. are for renewable resources.   Renewable resources are resources that replenish themselves over time.   For example, if your program is using too much CPU, it will be paused temporarily to allow other programs to run.    Trying to use too much of a renewable resource will cause a call to run slowly.

Alternatively, other resources like memory, disk used, sockets, etc. are not renewable.   In other words, the resource has a hard limit and is does does not automatically replenish itself over time.   When you use too much of one of these resources, the call in your program which causes it to be over the limit may raise an exception or in some cases the program may be killed outright.  

For more information about resources and restrictions see the resources and restrictions guide.

This concludes a brief tour of the Repy functionality.   This guide has covered all of the API calls for Repy.
