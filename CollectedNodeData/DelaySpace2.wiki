=== Modified divide-and-conquer algorithm ===
The all-pairs-ping algorithm we used is based on a modified divide-and-conquer algorithm. Therefore we use a central coordination instance to avoid interferences between each measurement try. 
To obtain the latency matrices with this approach we implement the two following programs: the "Controller"-Program that is monitoring and controlling the steps of the divide-and-conquer algorithm and the "Node"-Program that is responsible for performing the measurements on each tested Seattle vessel.
