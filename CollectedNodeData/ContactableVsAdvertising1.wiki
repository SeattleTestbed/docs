= Scatter Plot of Proportions of Time Contactable and Advertising =

[[Image(contactablevsadvertising.jpg)]]

This graph illustrates the high correlation between time spent advertising and time spent contactable. For the most part, the two values are the same. However, a number of nodes are contactable slightly more often than they are advertising and some IP addresses spent a significant proportion of the time advertising without actually being contactable.
