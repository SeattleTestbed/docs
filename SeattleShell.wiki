= Seash: The Seattle Shell =
Seash is a terminal interface for managing Seattle resources. This page is intended as a short overview of commands that one can run in Seash.


== Starting Seash ==
Seash can be started from the terminal by running the command {{{python seash.py}}}. Once Seash starts, it will print a line that starts with {{{!>}}}, and will wait for you to issue a command.


== Seash Commands ==
If you issue the {{{help}}} command in Seash, you will receive an output that describes all the commands Seash supports. Here's a listing of this output:

{{{
A target can be either a host:port:vesselname, %ID, or a group name.

on target [command]              -- Runs a command on a target (or changes the default)
as keyname [command]             -- Run a command using an identity (or changes the default).
add [target] [to group]          -- Adds a target to a new or existing group 
remove [target] [from group]     -- Removes a target from a group
show                             -- Displays shell state (use 'help show' for more info)

browse                           -- Find vessels I can control
genkeys fn [len] [as identity]   -- creates new pub / priv keys (default len=1024)
loadkeys fn [as identity]        -- loads filename.publickey and filename.privatekey
list                             -- Update and display information about the vessels
upload localfn (remotefn)        -- Upload a file

stop                             -- Stop an experiment
split resourcefn                 -- Split another vessel off of each vessel
join                             -- Join vessels on the same node
help [help | set | show ]        -- help information
